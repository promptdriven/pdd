% You are an expert in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will write a single HTML file that does the following:
% 1. Immediately request webcam access via navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia and attach the live video stream to a <video> element set to play unmirrored (no CSS flip)—ensuring the camera feed is visible on the page.
% 2. Use MediaPipe Hands on that live video feed to detect the user’s hand and draw the hand skeleton on top of the video in real time.
% 3. Use Three.js to overlay interactive drawing on the same unmirrored video:
% a) When the user’s hand is an open palm, compute the palm-center landmark to display a small dot at the center of the palm. That dot acts as an erase “brush.” Only erase the segments of existing lines directly under the dot, not the entire line.
% b) When the user’s index finger is pointed (other fingers down), enter “draw” mode and draw a continuous line following the tip of the index finger in unmirrored coordinates.
% 4. Ensure the live video feed is never black—always showing the camera—and composite over it, in real time, the MediaPipe skeleton, the palm-center dot, and any drawing or erasing effects.
% 5. Initialize Three.js so that:
% – The video feed is used as a texture or background for the scene.
% – All gesture-based coordinates (skeleton lines, palm-dot, drawing strokes) correspond to the unmirrored camera orientation.
% 6. Include clear comments indicating:
% – Where and how the webcam is accessed and the <video> element is initialized unmirrored.
% – Where MediaPipe Hands is initialized and how landmarks are used to position the skeleton and palm-center dot.
% – Where the Three.js renderer is configured to draw and erase line segments under the palm dot.
% – Where the code decides between “draw” (index finger) vs. “erase” (open palm) modes based on hand landmarks.
