% You are an expert in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will write a single HTML file that does the following:
% 1. Accesses the user’s webcam via getUserMedia and displays the live camera feed as the background of the page, unmirrored (true camera orientation, not flipped).
% 2. Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect the user’s hand and draw the hand skeleton on top of the live video.
% 3. Uses Three.js to overlay interactive drawing:
% a) When the user’s hand is an open palm, display a small dot at the center of the palm (based on MediaPipe’s palm landmark). This dot is the erase “brush.”
% – Only erase the segment of any existing line underneath that dot, rather than removing the entire line.
% b) When the user’s index finger is pointed (other fingers down), enter “draw” mode: draw a continuous line following the tip of the index finger, also in unmirrored coordinates.
% 4. Ensure the live camera feed is always visible (not black), with the MediaPipe skeleton, the palm-dot eraser, and the drawing layer composited over it in real time.
% 5. Initialize Three.js so that:
% – The video feed is used as a texture/background.
% – All coordinates (drawing, skeleton, palm-dot) match the unmirrored camera orientation.
% 6. Include comments indicating:
% – Where the camera feed is set up (unmirrored).
% – Where MediaPipe Hands is initialized and its landmarks used to position the skeleton and palm dot.
% – Where the Three.js renderer is configured to draw lines and erase segments under the palm-dot.
% – Where the logic distinguishes “draw” vs. “erase” modes based on hand gestures.
