% You are an expert in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will write a single HTML file that does the following:
% 1. Accesses the user’s webcam via getUserMedia and displays the live camera feed as the background of the page (not a black screen). Mirror the video feed, so if the user's hand goes right in real life, the hand should also go right on the camera feed.
% 2. Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect and draw the hand skeleton on top of the live video.
% 3. Uses Three.js to overlay interactive drawing:
% a) When the user’s hand is an open palm, enter “erase” mode: track the middle of open hand position and erase any previous markings at the middle of the open palm. Add a dot at the middle of the palm to show where it is erasing. 
% b) When the user’s index finger is extended (index fingertip landmark significantly above its PIP joint) and all other fingertips are below their respective PIP joints, enter “draw” mode: draw a smooth, continuous line by sampling the index fingertip position each frame to ensure consistent tracking.
% 4. Ensure the camera feed is visible at all times, with the MediaPipe skeleton and drawing layer composited over it.
% 5. Provide proper initialization so the Three.js renderer uses the video feed texture and renders the drawing and skeleton in real time.
% 6. Include comments to show where the camera feed is set up, where MediaPipe is initialized, and where drawing/erasing logic is implemented.
