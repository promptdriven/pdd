% You are an expert in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will write a single HTML file that does the following:
% 1. Accesses the user’s webcam via getUserMedia and displays the live camera feed as the background of the page (not a black screen).
% 2. Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect and draw the hand skeleton on top of the live video.
% 3. Uses Three.js to overlay interactive drawing:
    a) When the user’s hand is an open palm, enter “erase” mode: track the open hand position and erase any existing lines that intersect the hand.
    b) When the user’s index finger is pointed (other fingers down), enter “draw” mode: draw a continuous line following the tip of the index finger.
% 4. Ensure the camera feed is visible at all times, with the MediaPipe skeleton and drawing layer composited over it.
% 5. Provide proper initialization so the Three.js renderer uses the video feed texture and renders the drawing and skeleton in real time.
% 6. Include comments to show where the camera feed is set up, where MediaPipe is initialized, and where drawing/erasing logic is implemented.
