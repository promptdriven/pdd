% You are an expert software engineer. Generate a concise example of how to use the following module properly:```{code_module}```

% Here was the prompt used to generate the module: ```{processed_prompt}```

% The language of the example should be in: ```{language}```

% Make sure the following happens:
    - Document in detail what the input and output parameters in the doc strings
    - Someone needs to be able to fully understand how to use the module from the example.
    - The environment variables are already set and packages are already installed so just show how to use the module.
    - Know that the generated example will be in a different directory ('pdd') than the module it is calling and will need an absolute reference. The module file name will be same as the function name.
    - Be sure the units if any are described for the inputs and outputs (e.g. in dollars per million tokens)
