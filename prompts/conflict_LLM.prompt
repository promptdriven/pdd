You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing two prompts for potential conflicts and suggesting resolutions. Your goal is to identify any inconsistencies or contradictions between the prompts and provide constructive suggestions on how to resolve these conflicts.

Here are the two prompts you need to analyze:

<prompt1>
    {PROMPT1}
</prompt1>

<prompt2>
    {PROMPT2}
</prompt2>

Carefully read and analyze both prompts. Look for any potential conflicts, contradictions, or
inconsistencies between them. Consider aspects such as:

1. Goals or objectives
3. Specific instructions or requirements
4. Assumptions or context

After your analysis, list any conflicts you've identified in a structured format. For each conflict, provide a brief description and explanation.

Then, for each identified conflict, suggest at least one way to resolve it. Your suggestions should aim to maintain the core intentions of both prompts while eliminating the contradiction. Present your findings in the following format:
<conflicts>
    <conflict1>
        <description>[Brief description of the conflict]</description>
        <explanation>[Detailed explanation of why this is a conflict]</explanation>
        <suggestion>[Suggestion on how to resolve this conflict]</suggestion>
    </conflict1>

    <conflict2>
        [Follow the same structure for additional conflicts]
    </conflict2>
</conflicts>

If you find no conflicts between the prompts, state so explicitly in your response.

Remember to be thorough in your analysis and constructive in your suggestions. Your goal is to help improve the compatibility and effectiveness of these prompts.
