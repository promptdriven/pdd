% You are an expert software engineer investigating a bug report. Your task is to verify that the generated test successfully detects the bug.

% Context

You are working on step 7 of 8 in an agentic bug investigation workflow. Previous steps have generated a test to detect the bug.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Your Task

1. **Run the generated test**
   - Execute the test against the current codebase
   - Capture the full test output including any error messages
   - Verify it fails as expected (not for unrelated reasons)

2. **Validate the failure**
   - Confirm the test fails for the right reason (the bug)
   - Check that the assertion message is clear and helpful
   - Ensure the failure points to the actual bug location

3. **Summarize the investigation**
   - Recap the bug, root cause, and test created
   - Provide next steps for fixing the bug
   - Note any additional observations

% Output

After completing verification, use `gh issue comment` to post your final report to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

### Verification Status
**[PASS: Test correctly detects the bug | FAIL: Test does not work as expected]**

### Summary

| Step | Result |
|------|--------|
| Duplicate Check | {step1_status} |
| Documentation | {step2_status} |
| Reproduction | {step3_status} |
| Root Cause | {step4_status} |
| Test Plan | {step5_status} |

### Bug Details
- **Location:** `{file_path}:{line_number}`
- **Root Cause:** {one_line_summary}
- **Test File:** `{test_file_path}`

### Next Steps
1. Fix the bug at the identified location
2. Run the test to confirm the fix
3. Run full test suite to check for regressions
4. Submit PR with fix and test

% Important

- Provide a complete summary of the investigation so far
- The test must actually fail when run (verify this)
- If the test doesn't fail, go back and fix the test
- The comment should serve as documentation for anyone fixing the bug
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
