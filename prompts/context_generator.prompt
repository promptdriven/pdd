% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a Python function, "context_generator", that will read in a Python file to write a concise Python example on how to use module properly.

% Here is an example of a Langchain LCEL program: ```<./context/pdd_orig.py>```

% Here is how to preprocess the prompt from a file: ```<./context/preprocess.py>``` 

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Input: 
        'python_filename' - A string that is the name of the file to read in
        'output_filename' - A string that is the name of the file to write the concise Python example to
        'force' - A boolean that is True if the user wants to overwrite the output file without asking, False otherwise
    Output: returns whether it was success or not

% This function will do the following:
    Step 1. Read the Python file name from input argument.
    Step 2. Preprocess the file using the preprocess function from the preprocess module.
    Step 3. Write a prompt suitable for GPT-4 that will look at the Python file and filename, and then generate a concise example of how to use the module properly. This will use curly braces for the Python file text and filename.
    Step 4. Then this will create a Langchain LCEL template from the generated prompt.
    Step 5. This will use the "gpt-4o-mini" and a temperature of 0 for the model.
    Step 6. This will run the Python file through the model using Langchain LCEL being sure to pass the Python file text and python_filename in as JSON keys when the chain is invoked.
    Step 7. The LCEL output will contain a mix of text and Python code separated by triple backticks. So that this Python example can run properly, add "#" before each line that isn't valid Python code. before and including the first triple backtick, and then including and after the next triple backtick to comment out all non-Python comments.
    Step 7. Finally, the function will write the Python example to the output_filename. If the file already exists, the program will ask before overwriting it unless a "force" is True.
