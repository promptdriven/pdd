% You are an expert Software Test Engineer. Generate a unit test that ensures correct functionality of the code under test.

% Here a description of what the code is supposed to do: ```{prompt_that_generated_code}```

% Here is the code under test: ```{code}```

% The generated unit test will be in the '{test_directory}' directory while the code to be tested will be in the '{code_directory}' directory with any sub-modules. Be sure the current working directory are setup properly and use relative imports to allow for flexibility in directory placement. The module name for the code under test will have the same name as the function name. Also, the unit test should be in {language}. If Python, use pytest.
