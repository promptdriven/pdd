% You are an expert software engineer using Prompt-Driven Development (PDD). Your task is to implement the prompt changes analyzed in the previous step.

% Context

You are working on step 8 of 9 in an agentic change workflow. Previous steps analyzed exactly what prompt changes are needed.

**This step modifies files.** All changes are made in a git worktree to avoid affecting the main branch.

% PDD Background

<pdd_prompting_guide>
<include>docs/prompting_guide.md</include>
</pdd_prompting_guide>

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Worktree Path: {worktree_path}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Previous Step Outputs
<step6_output>
{step6_output}
</step6_output>

<step7_output>
{step7_output}
</step7_output>

% Your Task

1. **Navigate to worktree**
   - Change to the worktree directory: {worktree_path}
   - All file modifications happen here, not in the main repo

2. **Modify existing prompts**
   For each prompt identified for modification in Step 7:
   - Read the current prompt file
   - Apply the changes specified in Step 7
   - Preserve existing structure and formatting
   - Keep the prompt concise (10-30% of expected code size)

3. **Create new prompts**
   For each new prompt identified in Step 7:
   - Use the standard prompt structure:
     ```
     <include>context/python_preamble.prompt</include>

     % Goal
     [One sentence describing the module]

     % Role & Scope
     [Module purpose and boundaries]

     % Requirements
     1. [Testable requirement]
     2. [Testable requirement]
     ...

     % Dependencies
     <module_name><include>context/module_example.py</include></module_name>

     % Deliverables
     - Code: `pdd/module_name.py`
     ```

4. **Update example files** (if needed)
   - If interfaces change, update relevant example files in `context/`
   - Examples should show typical usage patterns

5. **Track changes**
   - Report all files modified with `FILES_MODIFIED:` prefix
   - Report all files created with `FILES_CREATED:` prefix

% Output

After completing your changes, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

**If changes successful:**
```markdown
## Step 8: Implement Changes

**Status:** Changes Applied

### Files Modified
FILES_MODIFIED: prompts/xxx_python.prompt, context/xxx_example.py

### Files Created
FILES_CREATED: prompts/yyy_python.prompt

### Summary of Changes

#### `prompts/xxx_python.prompt`
- Added requirement for [feature]
- Updated dependency to include [module]

#### `prompts/yyy_python.prompt` (new)
- Created new prompt for [purpose]
- Includes [N] requirements

### Worktree Location
Changes are in: `{worktree_path}`

### Next Steps
After review, run `pdd sync` on modified prompts to regenerate code.

---
*Proceeding to Step 9: Verify Changes*
```

**If changes failed (STOP workflow):**
```markdown
## Step 8: Implement Changes

**Status:** FAIL: Implementation Error

### Error Details
[What went wrong]

### Attempted Changes
[What was attempted before failure]

### Recommendation
[How to resolve the issue]

---
*Investigation paused - implementation failed.*
```

% Important

- All changes must be in the worktree, not the main repo
- Follow PDD prompt conventions strictly
- Include FILES_MODIFIED and FILES_CREATED lines for tracking
- If implementation fails, STOP the workflow
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
