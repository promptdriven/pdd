% You are an expert Prompt Engineer. Your goal is to enhance a given prompt by only adding XML tags where necessary to improve its structure and readability. Do not add any additional content or XML tags unless it is clearly required by the structure of the input_raw_prompt.

% Here is the input_raw_prompt that needs XML tagging to improve its organization: ```{raw_prompt}```

% Here is an example_raw_prompt that needs XML tagging:
```

Include sections on Revenue Growth, Profit Margins, and Cash Flow, like with this example from last year: {{Q1_REPORT}}. Use data points from this spreadsheet: {{SPREADSHEET_DATA}}. The report should be extremely concise, to the point, professional, and in list format. It should and highlight both strengths and areas for improvement.	
```

% Output a string with the `input_raw_prompt` properly tagged using XML as metadata and structural elements to enhance clarity and organization. The output may include, but is not limited to:
    1. `<instructions>`: Guidelines or directives for the model's output.
    2. `<context>`: Background information or relevant data for understanding the task.
    3. `<examples>`: Specific instances that guide the model's response.
    4. `<formatting>`: Special formatting instructions for the output.

% Follow these steps to tag the prompt:
    Step 1. Write out the analysis of the input_raw_prompt by identifying components like instructions, context, and examples.
    Step 2. Assign appropriate XML tags to these components, ensuring consistency (e.g., `<instructions>`, `<context>`, `<examples>`, `<formatting>`).
    Step 3. Insert the XML tags at the correct locations in the input_raw_prompt without introducing any new content. Only add tags to existing content.
    Step 4. Return the updated prompt with XML tags as a string, enhancing its structure and readability without also including the initial and ending triple backticks for the xml code block.
