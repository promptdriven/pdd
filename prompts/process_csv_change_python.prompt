% You are an expert Python Software Engineer. Your goal is to write a Python function, "process_csv_change", that will read in a take in a csv file name and call change_example for each of the lines.

<include>context/python_preamble.prompt</include>

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Inputs: 
        'csv_file' - A string containing the path to the csv file.
        'strength' - A float between 0 and 1 that represents the strength of the LLM model to use.
        'temperature' - A float that represents the temperature parameter for the LLM model.
        'code_directory' - A string containing the path to the directory where the code files are stored.
        'language' - A string representing the default programming language of the code files if they don't have a language suffix. 
        'extension' - A string representing the file extension of the code files. Includes the '.' in front of the extension.
        'budget' - A float representing the maximum cost allowed for the change process.
    Outputs:
        'success' - A boolean indicating whether the changes were successfully made.
        'list_of_jsons' - A list of dictionaries containing Key:file_name,  Value:modified_prompt.
        'total_cost' - A float representing the total cost of all fix attempts.
        'model_name' - A string representing the name of the LLM model used.

% Here are examples of how to use internal modules:
<internal_example_modules>
    % Here is an example of the change function that will be used: 
        <change_example><include>context/change_example.py</include></change_example>

    % Here is how to use the `get_extension` function:
        <get_extension_example>
        <include>context/get_extension_example.py</include>
        </get_extension_example>
</internal_example_modules>

% This function will do the following:
    Step 1. Read in the csv file with columns prompt_name and change_instructions.
        Note on prompt file path resolution:
        - For each prompt_name in the CSV file, attempt to locate the prompt file by trying:
            1. The exact path as specified in the CSV file
            2. The current working directory with the basename of the prompt_name
            3. The directory containing the CSV file with the basename of the prompt_name
            4. The code_directory with the basename of the prompt_name
        - If the prompt file is found in any of these locations, use it; otherwise, log an error and skip this row.
    
    Step 2. Loop through each line in the csv file:
        a. Initialize variables:
            - Initialize a list_of_jsons to store the modified prompts.
            - Read the prompt from the prompt_name column (text file).
            - Parse the prompt_name into a input_code name:
                i.  remove the path and suffix _language.prompt from the prompt_name
                ii. use the `get_extension` function to infer the extension of the input_code file, if it doesn't have a language suffix use the default input extension.
                iii. add the suffix extension to the prompt_name
                iv. change the directory to code_directory + path from prompt_name (Step i).
            - Read the input_code from the input_code_name as a string
            - Read the change_instructions from the change_instructions column
        b. Call the change function with the input_prompt, input_code, and change_prompt.
        c. Add the returned total_cost to the total cost accumulator.
        d. If the total cost exceeds the budget, break the loop.
        e. If the change was successful, add the modified prompt to the list_of_jsons. Use the original prompt_name (full path) as the "file_name" in the output dictionary. When saving individual files to a directory, preserve the original filenames without adding any prefix.
    Step 3. Return the success status, list of modified prompts, total cost, and model name.
