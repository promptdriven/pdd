% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a python function called 'load_prompt_template' that will load a prompt into a string.

<include>context/python_preamble.prompt</include>

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Input:
        'prompt_name' - The logical name of the prompt to load, without an extension. The function must append the default '.prompt' extension automatically.
    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The prompt template text, or None on error/missing file

% This function will do the following:
    Step 0. Validate input type: if 'prompt_name' is not a str, print a formatted error and return None.
    Step 1. Build an ordered list of candidate project roots:
        1) If $PDD_PATH is set, use that path first.
        2) The repository root inferred from this module (the parent directory of the module's folder).
        3) The current working directory.
    Step 2. For each candidate root, form a candidate file path at '<root>/prompts/{prompt_name}.prompt'.
    Step 3. Select the first candidate path that exists; if none exist, print a formatted error that includes all tried paths and return None.
    Step 4. Read the file contents as UTF-8 and return the text. On success, print a brief formatted success message. On I/O or unexpected errors, print a formatted error and return None.

% Notes/constraints:
    - 'prompt_name' must not include an extension; the function always appends '.prompt'.
    - All diagnostic messages should be printed (no exceptions raised) and the function should return None on failure.
    - The prompts are expected to live under a 'prompts/' subdirectory within each candidate project root.
