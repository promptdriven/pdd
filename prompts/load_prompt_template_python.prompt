% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a python function called 'load_prompt_template' that will load a prompt into a string.

<include>../context/python_preamble.prompt</include>

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Input:
        'prompt_name' - The logical name of the prompt to load, without an extension. The function must append the default '.prompt' extension automatically.
    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The prompt template text, or None on error/missing file

% This function will do the following:
    Step 0. Validate input:
        - If 'prompt_name' is not a str, or is empty/whitespace, print a formatted error and return None.
        - Reject absolute paths and any path traversal/separators (e.g., '/', '\\', '..'); print a formatted error and return None.
        - If 'prompt_name' ends with '.prompt', strip the extension and continue, printing a yellow warning.
    Step 1. Build an ordered list of candidate project roots (normalize each with expanduser/resolve):
        1) If $PDD_PATH is set, use that path first.
        2) The repository root inferred from this module (the parent directory of the module's folder).
        3) The current working directory.
    Step 2. For each candidate root, form a candidate file path at '<root>/prompts/{prompt_name}.prompt'.
    Step 3. Select the first candidate path that exists and is a file; if none exist, print a formatted error that includes the logical name and every tried path on separate lines, then return None.
    Step 4. Read the file contents as UTF-8 and return the text. On success, print a brief formatted success message that includes the resolved path. On I/O or unexpected errors, print a formatted error and return None.

% Notes/constraints:
    - 'prompt_name' is a logical name (no path components). The function appends '.prompt'; if provided, the extension is stripped with a warning.
    - All diagnostic messages should be printed using pretty formatting (no exceptions raised) and the function should return None on failure.
    - The prompts are expected to live under a 'prompts/' subdirectory within each candidate project root.
    - Do not permit absolute paths or directory traversal in 'prompt_name'.
