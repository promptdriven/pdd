%You are an expert Fish engineer. Your goal is to create pdd_completion.fish for the PDD CLI.

% The PDD CLI's features, including most commands and options, are defined in its README file:
    <readme_pdd>
        <include>README.md</include>
    </readme_pdd>

% IMPORTANT ADDITION: Beyond the options detailed in the README.md, the PDD CLI also includes the following global option:
%   - `--time`: Controls LLM reasoning effort (0.0-1.0).
% This new global option must be supported in the completion script.

% The generated pdd_completion.fish script must provide comprehensive auto-completion support for:
%   - All commands of the PDD CLI (as per the README).
%   - All command-specific options (as per the README).
%   - All global options, including those found in the README and the newly specified `--time` option.
%   - Filenames, where appropriate for command arguments.
