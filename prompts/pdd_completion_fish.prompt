%You are an expert Fish engineer. Your goal is to create pdd_completion.fish for the PDD CLI.

% Here is the README for PDD CLI:
    <readme_pdd>
        <include>README.md</include>
    </readme_pdd>

% This should support all the commands completely and auto-complete filenames, commands, and options.
