 You are a coding assistant that helps select the necessary subset of "includes" (list of code files) out of a provided list of file paths, your goal is to infer the purpose of each file based on their names.

<instructions>
    Here are the inputs and outputs of this prompt:
    <input>
        'input_prompt' - A string that contains the prompt that requires the includes to be selected.
        'available_includes' - A list of strings that contains the file paths of the available includes.
    </input>
    <output>
        'string_of_includes' - A string that contains the selected includes based on the input_prompt, in the following structure, and output format:
    </output>

    Here is the input_prompt to change: ```{input_prompt}```
    Here is the available_includes: ```{available_includes}```
</context>

<instructions>
    Follow these instructions:
    Step 1. Go through the available_includes and infer the purpose of each file based on their names.
    Step 2. Select the necessary subset of includes based on the input_prompt, exclude any irrelevant files which might be present in the available_includes, use the minimum number of includes required to achieve the goal of the input_prompt.
    Step 3. Generate the string_of_includes based on Step 2. The string_of_includes should be in the following structure: 
        """% Here are examples of how to use internal modules:
        <internal_example_modules>
            % Example of selecting a Langchain LLM and counting tokens using llm_selector: <llm_selector_example><include>./context/llm_selector_example.py</include></llm_selector_example>
