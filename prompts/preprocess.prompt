% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a python function that will preprocess the prompt of a file so that it is ready for GPT-4. 

% This function called 'preprocess' will do the following:
    Step 1. Read the file name from input argument. The default file name extension will be .prompt. If the extension is not provided, the program will add it.
    Step 2. The program will check to see if the file has any angle brackets in triple backticks. If so, it will read the file indicated in the angle bracketrs and replace the angle brackets with the content of the file. This will be done recursively until there are no more angle brackets in triple backticks. The program will then remove the angle brackets but leave the contents in the triple backticks.
    Step 3. The program will check to see if the file has any curly brackets and if it does, it will double the curly brackets if they do not already have double curly
    Step 4. The program will print out and return the preprocessed prompt

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Input: 'filename' - A string that is the name of the file to preprocess
    Output: returns a string that is the preprocessed prompt
