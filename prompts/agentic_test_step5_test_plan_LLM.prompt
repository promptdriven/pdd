% You are an expert software engineer handling a UI test generation request. Your task is to create a comprehensive test plan and verify it's achievable.

% Context

You are working on step 5 of 9 in an agentic UI test generation workflow. Previous steps have identified the frontend type and testing framework.

**This step may terminate the workflow** if the test plan is blocked by missing information.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Issue Author: @{issue_author}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Your Task

1. **Create comprehensive test plan**
   Based on the issue requirements and codebase research:
   - List all test scenarios to cover
   - Define test cases for each scenario
   - Specify selectors/locators for UI elements (web) or commands (CLI)
   - Include both happy path and edge case tests
   - Ensure everything visible/interactive is tested

2. **Verify plan is achievable**
   Check for blockers:
   - Are all required URLs/endpoints accessible?
   - Do we know how to authenticate (if needed)?
   - Are test data/fixtures available or can they be created?
   - Are there any external dependencies that might block tests?

3. **Identify any remaining blockers**
   If blocked, be specific about what's needed:
   - Credentials or authentication setup
   - Environment configuration
   - Test data requirements
   - External service access

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

**If plan is achievable:**
```markdown
## Step 5: Create Test Plan

**Status:** Plan Ready

### Test Plan Overview
- **Total Test Cases:** [N]
- **Framework:** [from Step 4]
- **Estimated Coverage:** [what will be covered]

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: [Name]
- **Description:** [What this tests]
- **Test Cases:**
  1. [Test case 1]
  2. [Test case 2]
  ...

#### Scenario 2: [Name]
- **Description:** [What this tests]
- **Test Cases:**
  1. [Test case 1]
  ...

### Test Configuration
- **Setup required:** [describe any setup]
- **Fixtures needed:** [list fixtures]
- **Cleanup:** [describe cleanup if needed]

*Proceeding to Step 6: Generate Tests*
```

**If plan is BLOCKED (STOP workflow):**
```markdown
## Step 5: Create Test Plan

**Status:** PLAN_BLOCKED

### Blockers Identified
The test plan cannot proceed due to:

1. [Blocker 1 - e.g., "Need credentials for admin dashboard"]
2. [Blocker 2 - e.g., "External API key required"]
...

### What We Need
@{issue_author} - To proceed with test generation, please provide:

1. [Specific requirement 1]
2. [Specific requirement 2]
...

### Partial Plan (for reference)
[Include what tests could be created once blockers are resolved]

---
*Test generation paused - plan blocked by missing requirements.*
```

% Machine-Readable Output (REQUIRED)

**You MUST output this line at the very end of your response.**

If plan is ready:
```
TEST_PLAN_STATUS: READY
```

If plan is blocked:
```
TEST_PLAN_STATUS: PLAN_BLOCKED
```

% Important

- **STOP the workflow** if status is "PLAN_BLOCKED"
- Tag the issue author (@username) when requesting info
- Be comprehensive - test everything visible/interactive
- Include both positive tests and error handling tests
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
