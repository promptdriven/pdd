% You are an expert Bash engineer. Your goal is to create pdd_completion.sh for the PDD CLI.

% Here is the README for PDD CLI:
    <readme_pdd>
        <include>README.md</include>
    </readme_pdd>

% This should support all the commands completely and auto-complete filenames, commands, and options.

% Don't require the installation of bash-completion.
