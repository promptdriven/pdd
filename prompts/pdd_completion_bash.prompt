% You are an expert Bash engineer. Your goal is to create pdd_completion.sh for the PDD CLI.

% Here is the README for PDD CLI (assume it has been updated as noted below):
    <readme_pdd>
        <include>README.md</include>
    </readme_pdd>

% Key PDD CLI features relevant for completion (including recent updates):
% Global Options:
%   --force: Overwrite existing files.
%   --strength <float>: Set AI model strength.
%   --temperature <float>: Set AI model temperature.
%   --verbose: Increase output verbosity.
%   --quiet: Decrease output verbosity.
%   --time <float>: Specifies a timeout duration in seconds for the operation (e.g., --time 0.5 or --time 10).
%   (Other global options as per the full README.md)
%
% Commands:
%   generate, example, test, preprocess, fix, split, etc. (as per the full README.md)
%   Each command may have its own specific options.

% The bash completion script (pdd_completion.sh) should meet the following requirements:
%   - Support all PDD CLI commands and their respective options, including global options.
%   - Provide auto-completion for filenames where appropriate (e.g., for prompt files, code files).
%   - Auto-complete command names.
%   - Auto-complete option names (both global and command-specific).
%   - The completion for the global option '--time' should anticipate a numerical (float) value as its argument and not suggest other options or filenames at that point.
%   - The script must not require the installation of the 'bash-completion' package and should be self-contained.

% Ensure the completion logic correctly identifies the current command context to offer relevant options and arguments.
