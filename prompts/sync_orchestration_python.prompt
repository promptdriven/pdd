# sync_orchestration_python.prompt

Create a Python module that orchestrates the complete PDD (Prompt-Driven Development) sync workflow by coordinating operations and animations in parallel.

## Context

<whitepaper>
    <include>./docs/whitepaper.md</include>
</whitepaper>

The sync command is the primary command in PDD that automatically executes the complete workflow loop from dependency injection through code generation, testing, and verification. This orchestration module coordinates the execution while providing real-time feedback to users.

## Architecture

This module works in conjunction with `sync_main`, which handles the CLI interface:

- **sync_main**: Handles CLI parameter extraction, validation, language detection, path resolution via `construct_paths()`, and .pddrc configuration management
- **sync_orchestration**: Focuses solely on workflow orchestration, animation coordination, and operation execution using the resolved paths provided by sync_main

The separation allows sync_main to handle all CLI and configuration concerns while sync_orchestration handles the core workflow logic.

## Requirements

Create a module with the following main function:

```python
def sync_orchestration(
    basename: str,
    target_coverage: float = 90.0,
    language: str = "python",
    prompts_dir: str = "prompts",
    code_dir: str = "src",
    examples_dir: str = "examples",
    tests_dir: str = "tests",
    max_attempts: int = 3,
    budget: float = 10.0,
    skip_verify: bool = False,
    skip_tests: bool = False,
    log: bool = False,
    force: bool = False,
    strength: float = 0.5,
    temperature: float = 0.0,
    time_param: float = 0.25,
    verbose: bool = False,
    quiet: bool = False,
    output_cost: Optional[str] = None,
    review_examples: bool = False,
    local: bool = False,
    context_config: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Orchestrate the complete PDD sync workflow with parallel animation.
    
    If log=True, display sync log for this basename instead of running sync.
    The verbose flag (global option) controls detail level of log output.

    The directory parameters (prompts_dir, code_dir, examples_dir, tests_dir) 
    specify the base locations for different file types. These are typically
    resolved by sync_main using construct_paths() based on .pddrc configuration
    and CLI context settings before being passed to this function.
    
    The context_config parameter can provide additional path overrides or
    configuration settings that affect file resolution.
    
    Returns a dictionary with:
    - 'success': bool indicating overall success
    - 'operations_completed': List of completed operations
    - 'skipped_operations': List of operations that were skipped
    - 'total_cost': float total cost of all operations
    - 'total_time': float total time elapsed
    - 'final_state': Dict with final file states
    - 'errors': List of any errors encountered
    - 'log_entries': List of log entries (when log=True)
    """
```

Here are examples of how to use the internal functions:
<examples>
    - Here is how to use the `sync_animation` function:
      <sync_animation_example>
        <include>context/sync_animation_example.py</include>
      </sync_animation_example>
      
    - Here is how to use the `sync_determine_operation` function:
      <sync_determine_operation_example>
        <include>context/sync_determine_operation_example.py</include>
      </sync_determine_operation_example>

        <include>context/update_main_example.py</include>
      </update_main_example>
</examples>

## Workflow Orchestration

The module should implement the PDD workflow as described in the whitepaper:

1. **Log Mode Check**: If `--log` flag is set, display sync log and return. The log display should show:
   - **Normal Mode**: Concise format showing timestamp, operation, reason, cost comparison, success status, and duration
     ```
     [2024-01-15 10:30:45] generate    | Code file does not exist | ✓ $0.47 (est: $0.50) | 17.3s
     [2024-01-15 10:31:03] test        | Progress the workflow    | ✓ $0.62 (est: $0.60) | 23.1s
     [2024-01-15 10:31:27] fix         | 2 tests failed           | ✗ Error: Budget exceeded
     ```
   - **Verbose Mode**: Detailed format including confidence, decision type, model, and details
     ```
     [2024-01-15 10:30:45] generate    | Code file does not exist
       Decision Type: heuristic | Confidence: 1.0
       Cost: $0.47 (estimated: $0.50) | Model: claude-3-5-sonnet
       Duration: 17.3s | Budget Remaining: $9.53
       Details: {"prompt_exists": true, "code_exists": false}
     ```
   - Clear indication if no log exists or log is empty
   - Handle special event entries (lock_acquired, budget_warning, etc.)
2. **Single Instance Enforcement**: Use `sync_determine_operation` to acquire lock and prevent concurrent runs
3. **Initial Analysis**: Analyze current file state to determine starting point
4. **Operation Loop**: Execute operations in sequence until synchronized
5. **Parallel Animation**: Run `sync_animation` in a separate thread throughout
6. **Lock Management**: Ensure lock is released on completion or failure
7. **Error Handling**: Handle failures and retry logic within budget constraints
8. **Final Reporting**: Summarize results and costs

### Core Workflow Steps

The orchestrator should execute these operations in order as determined by `sync_determine_operation`:

1. **auto-deps**: Find and inject relevant dependencies into the prompt
2. **generate**: Create or update the code module from the prompt  
3. **example**: Generate usage example if it doesn't exist or is outdated
4. **crash**: Fix any runtime errors to make code executable
5. **verify**: Run functional verification against prompt intent (unless --skip-verify)
6. **test**: Generate comprehensive unit tests (unless --skip-tests)
7. **fix**: Resolve any bugs found by unit tests
8. **update**: Back-propagate any learnings to the prompt file

### Sync Log Format

The sync log should be stored at `.pdd/meta/{basename}_{language}_sync.log` as a JSONL file (one JSON object per line). Each log entry represents a complete operation with both decision and result information:

**Complete Operation Entry**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "operation": "generate",
  "reason": "Code file does not exist",
  "decision_type": "heuristic",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "estimated_cost": 0.50,
  "actual_cost": 0.47,
  "success": true,
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "duration": 17.3,
  "error": null,
  "details": {
    "prompt_exists": true,
    "code_exists": false,
    "prompt_hash": "abc123...",
    "fingerprint_found": false,
    "budget_remaining": 9.53
  }
}
```

**Special Event Entries** (for system events):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:44.000Z",
  "event": "lock_acquired",
  "details": {"pid": 12345}
}
```

The `decision_type` field distinguishes between:
- `"heuristic"`: Deterministic decisions based on file states
- `"llm"`: Decisions made using LLM analysis for complex conflicts

This enables users to understand:
- What operations were performed during each sync
- Why each operation was chosen with confidence levels
- The decision-making process (heuristic vs LLM-based)
- Actual cost vs estimated cost comparison for budget analysis
- Which models were used for each operation
- Success/failure status with error details
- Performance metrics (duration)
- Budget tracking throughout the sync process
- Detailed context for debugging complex scenarios

### Handling Skipped Operations
If `--skip-verify` or `--skip-tests` flags are used, the orchestrator should not simply ignore the step. To ensure the state machine progresses correctly, it should:
1. Log that the operation was skipped.
2. Simulate a successful run for that operation by creating a `RunReport` and saving it. This updates the state, allowing `sync_determine_operation` to correctly select the next step.
3. Handle cascading skip effects:
   - If `skip_tests` is True, also skip `verify` operations (can't verify without tests)
   - If `skip_tests` is True, also skip `crash` operations (crash fixes usually require test execution)
4. Create appropriate dummy RunReports for skipped operations:
   - For verify operations: Create RunReport with zero test results and appropriate skip reason
   - For test operations: Create RunReport with perfect coverage assumption when skipped
   - For crash operations: Create RunReport indicating the operation was skipped due to missing files or test skip requirements

### Parallel Animation System

The module should:

1. **Start Animation Thread**: Launch `sync_animation` before beginning operations
2. **Update Animation State**: Use mutable list references to update animation in real-time:
   - `function_name_ref`: Current operation being executed
   - `cost_ref`: Running total of costs
   - `prompt_color/code_color/example_color/tests_color`: Visual status indicators
   - `prompt_path_ref/code_path_ref/example_path_ref/tests_path_ref`: File paths
3. **Stop Animation**: Set stop_event when workflow completes

### Operation Execution

For each operation:

1. **Determine Next Step**: Call `sync_determine_operation` which returns a `SyncDecision` object containing:
   - `operation`: The operation to perform ('generate', 'test', 'verify', etc.)
   - `reason`: Human-readable explanation of why this operation was chosen
   - `confidence`: Float (0.0-1.0) indicating confidence in the decision
   - `estimated_cost`: Float representing estimated cost in dollars
   - `details`: Optional dict with additional context about the decision
2. **Create Log Entry**: Create initial log entry with:
   ```python
   log_entry = create_sync_log_entry(decision, budget - current_cost_ref[0])
   ```
3. **Update Animation**: Set `function_name_ref` to the current operation.
4. **Execute Command**: Run the appropriate PDD `*_main` function, tracking start time.
5. **Update Log Entry**: After execution, update the entry with actual results:
   ```python
   duration = time.time() - start_time
   update_sync_log_entry(log_entry, {
       'success': success,
       'cost': actual_cost,      # Extracted from command result
       'model': model_name,      # Extracted from command result
       'error': error_message if not success else None
   }, duration)
   append_sync_log(basename, language, log_entry)
   ```
6. **Track Results**: Update cost, file paths, and status colors.
7. **Persist State**: **If the operation was successful, save a new `Fingerprint` to disk.** This updates the state so the next call to `sync_determine_operation` can make a new decision.
8. **Handle Errors**: Implement retry logic up to `max_attempts` or break the loop on a definitive failure.

### Special Event Logging

The orchestrator should also log important system events:

- **Lock Events**: When sync lock is acquired/released
- **Budget Warnings**: When budget is running low (< 20% remaining)
- **Cycle Detection**: When crash-verify loops are detected and broken
- **Skip Events**: When operations are skipped due to flags

### State and Path Management

The orchestrator should:

- **Construct File Paths**: Use the `get_pdd_file_paths(basename, language, prompts_dir)` helper function to resolve all required file paths, using the provided directory parameters as base paths.
- **Track File States**: Monitor which files exist and their modification times
- **Update Animation Colors**: Set colors based on file status:
  - Green: File exists and up-to-date
  - Yellow: File being processed
  - Red: File has errors or missing
  - Blue: File analysis in progress
- **Manage Lock Lifecycle**: Ensure sync lock is properly acquired at start and released at end
- **Handle Lock Failures**: Exit gracefully if another sync is already running

### Error Handling and Recovery

Implement robust error handling:

- **Path Construction Validation**: Validate file paths early and exit gracefully on failures with clear error messages
- **Lock Acquisition Failure**: Exit immediately with clear message if another sync is running
- **Budget Constraints**: Stop if total cost exceeds budget
- **File Validation**: Validate required files exist before operations (especially for crash operations that need both code and example files)
- **LLM Error Recovery**: Handle LLM failures gracefully, skipping operations when appropriate (e.g., "LLM returned None" errors)
- **Subprocess Timeout Handling**: Implement timeouts for test execution and example runs to prevent hanging
- **Actual Error Capture**: For fix operations, capture real test failure information by re-running tests and capturing stdout/stderr output to provide meaningful error context
- **Return Value Handling**: Handle different return formats from command functions:
  - Dictionary format: Extract 'success', 'cost', and 'model' fields directly
  - Tuple format: Treat as successful if no exceptions, extract cost from second-to-last element and model from last element
  - Ensure fingerprint state is saved after successful operations regardless of return format
- **Enhanced Cycle Detection**: Detect and break crash-verify cycles with configurable repeat limits (e.g., MAX_CYCLE_REPEATS = 2)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue workflow even if non-critical steps fail
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages through animation
- **Lock Cleanup**: Always release lock, even on exceptions or early exits

### Integration with Main Components

The orchestrator should import and use:

```python
from .sync_determine_operation import sync_determine_operation
from .sync_animation import sync_animation
from .auto_deps_main import auto_deps_main
from .code_generator_main import code_generator_main
from .context_generator_main import context_generator_main
from .crash_main import crash_main
from .fix_verification_main import fix_verification_main
from .cmd_test_main import cmd_test_main
from .fix_main import fix_main
from .update_main import update_main
```

### Required Dependencies

The module requires these additional imports:

```python
import threading
import time
import json
import datetime
import subprocess
import re
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, List
from dataclasses import asdict

import click
# Note: rich.console.Console not used in current implementation
```

### Command Execution Pattern

For each PDD operation, construct appropriate arguments based on the up-to-date usage patterns found in the corresponding test files, which are included in the `<examples>` section of this prompt. The orchestrator is responsible for adapting these examples into robust calls that handle cost tracking, state persistence, and retry logic.

### Helper Functions for State Management

The orchestrator should implement these helper functions for proper state management:

- **load_sync_log(basename, language)**: Load sync log entries from the metadata directory
- **create_sync_log_entry(decision, budget_remaining)**: Create initial log entry from decision with all fields (actual results set to None initially)
- **update_sync_log_entry(entry, result, duration)**: Update log entry with execution results (actual_cost, success, model, duration, error)
- **append_sync_log(basename, language, entry)**: Append completed log entry to the sync log file
- **save_run_report(report, basename, language)**: Save RunReport data to enable state progression
- **_save_operation_fingerprint(basename, language, operation, paths, cost, model)**: Save fingerprint state after successful operations to update the workflow state machine

### Test Execution Integration

The orchestrator should include test execution functionality to create proper RunReports:

- **_execute_tests_and_create_run_report(test_file, basename, language, target_coverage)**: Execute pytest with coverage reporting and parse results into RunReport objects. This enables the state machine to detect test failures and trigger fix operations in subsequent sync runs.

### Post-Operation Validation

After successful operations, the orchestrator should validate results:

- **After 'crash' operations**: Re-run the example program to verify the crash is fixed and update run reports with actual execution results
- **After 'fix' operations**: Execute tests to verify fixes worked and update run reports with current test status
- **After 'test' operations**: Execute generated tests to create initial run reports for failure detection in subsequent sync runs

### Output Format

Return comprehensive results:

```python
{
    'success': True,
    'operations_completed': ['auto-deps', 'generate', 'example', 'verify', 'test'],
    'total_cost': 2.45,
    'total_time': 120.5,
    'final_state': {
        'prompt': {'exists': True, 'path': '...', 'status': 'current'},
        'code': {'exists': True, 'path': '...', 'status': 'generated'},
        'example': {'exists': True, 'path': '...', 'status': 'current'},
        'test': {'exists': True, 'path': '...', 'status': 'passing'}
    },
    'errors': [],
    'skipped_operations': ['verify'] if skip_verify else []
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Lock Management**: Use context managers or try/finally for reliable lock cleanup
2. **Threading**: Use threading.Thread for animation, threading.Event for coordination
3. **Context Management**: Create Click context objects for command execution
4. **Path Resolution**: Use provided directory parameters with pathlib.Path for cross-platform compatibility
5. **File Operations**: Use pathlib.Path for all file operations
6. **Cost Tracking**: Accumulate costs from all operations, handling both dict and tuple return formats
7. **Time Tracking**: Monitor elapsed time for each operation
8. **Exception Handling**: Catch and handle all operation failures gracefully, always releasing locks
9. **Return Format Compatibility**: Handle both dictionary and tuple return values from command functions
10. **Error Recovery**: Handle operation failures gracefully and break workflow loop on definitive failures
11. **State Persistence**: Always save fingerprint state after successful operations to enable workflow progression
12. **Version Handling**: Import PDD version dynamically using `from . import __version__` and use it when creating Fingerprint objects for the pdd_version field instead of hardcoding version strings
13. **Debug Output**: Debug print statements may be included during development but should be configurable or removable for production use

## Dependencies

- Standard library modules (threading, time, pathlib, subprocess, json)
- Click for context management
- All PDD command modules for operation execution
- sync_determine_operation for workflow intelligence
- sync_animation for user feedback

## Usage Examples

```python
# Basic sync execution
result = sync_orchestration(
    basename="calculator",
    language="python"
)

# View sync log
result = sync_orchestration(
    basename="calculator",
    language="python",
    log=True
)

# View detailed sync log (with verbose flag)
result = sync_orchestration(
    basename="calculator", 
    language="python",
    log=True,
    verbose=True
)

# Result handling
if not result['success']:
    if 'lock_conflict' in result.get('errors', []):
        print("Another sync is already running for this module")
        exit(1)

# Advanced sync with custom directories  
result = sync_orchestration(
    basename="data_processor",
    language="python",
    prompts_dir="backend/prompts",
    code_dir="backend/src",
    examples_dir="backend/examples", 
    tests_dir="backend/tests",
    budget=15.0,
    target_coverage=95.0,
    skip_verify=False
)
```

## Main Workflow and Lock Integration

The orchestrator must use the `SyncLock` context manager to ensure only one sync process runs at a time for a given unit. The entire workflow should be wrapped in this lock.

```python
def sync_orchestration(..., log=False, verbose=False):
    # Handle log mode first
    if log:
        # Code to display the log...
        return

    try:
        # The main workflow is wrapped in the SyncLock context manager.
        # This will raise TimeoutError if the lock is already held.
        with SyncLock(basename, language) as lock:
            
            # 1. Start animation thread here
            # ...

            # 2. Begin the main workflow loop
            while True:
                # 3. Determine the next operation
                decision = sync_determine_operation(...)
                
                # 4. Create log entry with decision info
                log_entry = create_sync_log_entry(decision, budget - current_cost_ref[0])
                
                # 5. Execute the operation and track timing
                start_time = time.time()
                # ... execute operation ...
                
                # 6. Update log entry with execution results and save
                duration = time.time() - start_time
                update_sync_log_entry(log_entry, {
                    'success': success,
                    'cost': actual_cost,
                    'model': model_name,
                    'error': error_message if not success else None
                }, duration)
                append_sync_log(basename, language, log_entry)
                
                # 7. Save new state (fingerprint) on success
                # ...

                # 8. Break loop if finished, in conflict, or on error
                if decision.operation in ['nothing', 'fail_and_request_manual_merge']:
                    break
    
    except TimeoutError:
        # Handle the case where the lock could not be acquired
        return {'success': False, 'errors': ['Another sync process is running.']}
    
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other unexpected errors
        # ...

    finally:
        # 7. Stop animation thread
        # ...

    # 8. Return final results
    # ...
```

The module should be the central coordinator that brings together all PDD components into a seamless, animated workflow that embodies the prompt-driven development philosophy described in the whitepaper.
