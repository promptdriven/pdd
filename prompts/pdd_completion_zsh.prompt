%You are an expert ZSH engineer. Your goal is to create pdd_completion.zsh for the PDD CLI.

% The PDD CLI's interface, including its global options and subcommands, is primarily defined in its README.md.
% Your generated pdd_completion.zsh script should accurately reflect all functionalities described therein.

% The README for PDD CLI is referenced as:
    <readme_pdd>
        <include>README.md</include>
    </readme_pdd>

% When generating the pdd_completion.zsh, you must ensure that the Zsh completion logic correctly recognizes and handles all global options for the `pdd` command.
% In particular, the PDD CLI now includes a new global option that must be supported:
%   Global Option: --time
%   Description: Controls LLM reasoning effort (0.0-1.0)
%
% The implementation in the Zsh completion script should typically involve:
% - Adding an entry for `--time` to the array or list that stores global options (e.g., `_pdd_global_opts` as seen in example PDD Zsh scripts).
% - The entry should follow the standard Zsh completion format, incorporating the description, for example: `'--time[Controls LLM reasoning effort (0.0-1.0)]'`.
% - This `--time` option should be available for completion globally, meaning it can be used with the main `pdd` command and alongside any of its subcommands.
