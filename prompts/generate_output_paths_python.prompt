% You are an expert Python software engineer. Your task is to implement a function called `generate_output_paths` that creates appropriate output filenames for different commands in the 'pdd' Python program.

% Inputs: The function should take the following parameters:
    - `command` (string): The command being executed (e.g., 'generate', 'example', 'test', 'preprocess', 'fix').
    - `output_locations` (dict): The output dictionary with keys (e.g., 'output', 'output-test') and the value of those options if specified by user.
    - `basename` (string): The base name of the file.
    - `language` (string): The programming language of the file.
    - `file_extension` (string): The file extension to be used.

% Outputs: The function should return a dictionary representing the generated output filename(s) with the full path for each of the keys in the `output_locations` dictionary.

% Here is a detailed description of the program functionality and the many ways output file names can be constructed: ```<./context/README.md>```

% Implement the function to handle all these cases efficiently and return the appropriate filename as a string, accordingly.

% Ensure the function handles all cases correctly and returns the appropriate filename string, language, and file extension. The function should be robust and able to handle various edge cases, such as missing file extensions or languages.

% Follow these steps:
    Step 1. List out all the different ways output locations can be constructed.
    Step 2. List out the default naming conventions for each command.
    Step 3. Write the code that implements the function to implement all these cases efficiently from Step 1 and 2.
