% You are an expert Python software engineer. Your task is to implement a function called `generate_output_paths` that creates appropriate output filenames for different commands in the 'pdd' Python program.

% Inputs: The function should take the following parameters:
    - `command` (string): The command being executed (e.g., 'generate', 'example', 'test', 'preprocess', 'fix', 'sync', 'change', 'update', 'detect', 'conflicts', 'crash', 'trace', 'bug', 'auto-deps', 'verify', 'split').
    - `output_locations` (dict): The output dictionary with keys (e.g., 'output', 'output_test') and the value of those options if specified by user.
    - `basename` (string): The base name of the file.
    - `language` (string): The programming language of the file.
    - `file_extension` (string): The file extension to be used.
    - `context_config` (dict): Optional dictionary with context-specific paths (e.g. from .pddrc).
    - `input_file_dir` (string): Optional path to the input file's directory used for relative path resolution.

% Outputs: The function should return a dictionary representing the generated output filename(s) with the full path for each of the keys in the `output_locations` dictionary.

% Here is a detailed description of the program functionality and the many ways output file names can be constructed: <program_description><include>README.md</include></program_description>

% Implement the function to handle all these cases efficiently. If the output_location key has a '/' at the end or is the name of a directory, this means it is a directory and the basename should be appended to the end of the directory according to the default naming conventions.

% The function must follow this specific precedence order for determining the output path:
   1. User-specified path (in `output_locations`)
   2. Context configuration path (in `context_config`)
   3. Environment variable
   4. Default naming convention

% Additionally, if `input_file_dir` is provided, default paths and relative paths from context/env should be resolved relative to that directory.

% Ensure the function handles all cases correctly and returns the appropriate filename string, language, and file extension. The function should be robust and able to handle various edge cases, such as missing file extensions or languages.

% Follow these steps:
    Step 1. List out all the different ways output locations can be constructed, including the precedence order (User > Context > Env > Default) and how `input_file_dir` affects relative path resolution.
    Step 2. List out the default naming conventions for all supported commands (including 'change', 'update', 'detect', 'conflicts', 'crash', 'trace', 'bug', 'auto-deps', 'verify').
    Step 3. List out all the environment variables that can be used to override the default naming conventions.
    Step 4. Identify potential error cases that need to be handled.
    Step 5. Write the code that implements the function to implement all these situations efficiently from the above steps.
    Step 6. Make sure the output dictionary has all the necessary default keys even if they are not specified by the user for the `output_locations` dictionary.

% Note: For commands like 'fix' and 'split' that have multiple outputs, use underscores in the keys of the `output_locations` dictionary (e.g., 'output_test', 'output_code', 'output_sub', 'output_modified') instead of hyphens.
