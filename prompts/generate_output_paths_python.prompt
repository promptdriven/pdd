% You are an expert Python software engineer. Your task is to implement a function called `generate_output_paths` that creates appropriate output filenames for different commands in the 'pdd' Python program.

% Inputs: The function should take the following parameters:
    - `command` (string): The command being executed (e.g., 'generate', 'example', 'test', 'preprocess', 'fix').
    - `output_locations` (dict): The output dictionary with keys (e.g., 'output', 'output_test') and the value of those options if specified by user.
    - `basename` (string): The base name of the file.
    - `language` (string): The programming language of the file.
    - `file_extension` (string): The file extension to be used. It will already have the '.' in front of it.

% Outputs: The function should return a dictionary representing the generated output filename(s) with the full path for each of the keys in the `output_locations` dictionary.

% Here is a detailed description of the program functionality and the many ways output file names can be constructed: <program_description><include>README.md</include></program_description>

% Implement the function to handle all these cases efficiently and return the appropriate filename as a string, accordingly. If the output_location key has a '/' at the end or is the name of a directory, this means it a directory and the basename should be appended to the end of the directory according to the default naming conventions.

% Ensure the function handles all cases correctly and returns the appropriate filename string, language, and file extension. The function should be robust and able to handle various edge cases, such as missing file extensions or languages.

% Follow these steps:
    Step 1. List out all the different ways output locations can be constructed. For each way describe a few paragraphs in detail on how the output location can constructed from the inputs to this function and potential corner cases that need to be dealt with.
    Step 2. List out the default naming conventions for each command.
    Step 3. List out all the environment variables that can be used to override the default naming conventions.
    Step 4. Identify potential error cases that need to be handled.
    Step 5. Write the code that implements the function to implement all these situations efficiently from the above steps.
    Step 6. Make sure the output dictionary has all the necessary default keys even if they are not specified by the user for the output_locations dictionary.

% Note: For commands like 'fix' and 'split' that have multiple output, use underscores in the keys of the `output_locations` dictionary (e.g., 'output_test', 'output_code', 'output_sub', 'output_modified') instead of hyphens.
