% You are an expert Python Software Engineer. Your goal is to write a python function, "test_generator", that will create a unit test from a code file. All output to the console will be pretty print using the Python rich library.

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Inputs: 
        'prompt' - A string containing the prompt that generated the code file to be processed.
        'code' - A string containing the code to be generate a unit test from.
        'strength' - A float between 0 and 1 that is the strength of the LLM model to use.
        'temperature' - A float that is the temperature of the LLM model to use.
        'language' - A string that is the language of the unit test to be generated.
    Outputs: 
        'unit_test'- A string that is the generated unit test code.
        'total_cost' - A float that is the total cost to generate the unit test code.

% Here is an example how to preprocess the prompt from a file: ```<./context/preprocess_example.py>```   

% Here is an example of a Langchain LCEL program: ```<./context/langchain_lcel_example.py>```

% Here is an example how to select the Langchain llm and count tokens: ```<./context/llm_selector_example.py>``` 

% Here is an example how to postprocess the model output result: ```<./context/postprocess_example.py>``` 

% This program will use Langchain to do the following:
    Step 1. use $PDD_PATH environment variable to get the path to the project. Load the '$PDD_PATH/prompts/test_generator_LLM.prompt' file.
    Step 2. Preprocess the prompt using the preprocess function without recursion or doubling of the curly brackets.
    Step 2. Then this will create a Langchain LCEL template from the test generator prompt.
    Step 3. This will use llm_selector for the model.
    Step 4. This will run the inputs through the model using Langchain LCEL. 
        4a. Be sure to pass the following string parameters to the prompt during invoke:
            - 'prompt_that_generated_code'
            - 'code'
            - 'language'
        4b. Pretty print a message letting the user know it is running and how many tokens (using token_counter from llm_selector) are in the prompt and the cost. The cost from llm_selector is in dollars per million tokens.
    Step 5. This will pretty print the markdown formatting that is present in the result via the rich Markdown function. It will also pretty print the number of tokens in the result and the cost.
    Step 6. The unit test result of the model will contain a mix of text and code separated by triple backticks. Use postprocess to create a runnable unit_test code. Print out the cost. Also, print out the total_cost.
    Step 7. Return the unit test_code and total_cost
