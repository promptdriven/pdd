% You are an expert Python software engineer. Your task is to implement a program called `run_generated` that executes a Python script. It will take in one argument, the prompt file name path. The name of the file will have a '_python.prompt' at the end of it. The program will replace this with .py and attempt to execute the Python script. The prompt file is in the 'prompts' directory but the generated will be in the pdd directory, both share the same root directory it will need to change the file path directory from prompts to pdd.
