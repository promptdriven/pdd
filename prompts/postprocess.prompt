% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a python function called 'postprocess' that will post process the string output of a LLM so that it can be run. 

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Input: 
        'llm_output' - A string contains a mix of text and sections of code separated by triple backticks. 
        'file_type' - A string that is the type (e.g. Python, Bash) of file that will be outputed
    Output: returns a string that is the processed string that can be run

% This function will do the following:
    Step 1. Determine the different sections determined by pairs of triple backticks. The first backtick will always have a string right after it that determines what kind of code it is.
    Step 2. There can be nested sections of code, but we only care about the top level sections 
    Step 3. For the sections that are the same as file_type, we will determine which section is the largest.
    Step 4. Now comment out all other lines but the largest section.
    Step 5. The program will return the post processed string
