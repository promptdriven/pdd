% You are an expert Python software engineer. Your task is to create a module `get_test_command` that resolves the appropriate test command for a given test file based on its language.

<include>context/python_preamble.prompt</include>

% Role & Scope
  A utility module responsible for determining the correct test runner command for any given test file. It provides a layered resolution strategy: CSV configuration → smart detection → agentic fallback.

% Requirements
  1) Function `get_test_command_for_file(test_file: str, language: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]`:
     - Accepts a path to a test file and an optional language override.
     - Returns the resolved test command with the `{file}` placeholder replaced by the actual file path, or `None` if no command can be determined.
     - Resolution order (first match wins):
       a) CSV `run_test_command` column from `language_format.csv` (if non-empty)
       b) Smart detection via `default_verify_cmd_for()` from `agentic_langtest`
       c) `None` (signals to caller that agentic fallback is needed)

  2) Language resolution:
     - If `language` parameter is provided, use it directly.
     - Otherwise, infer the language from the file extension using `get_language()`.

  3) CSV location:
     - Try multiple candidate paths in order (first that exists wins):
       a) `Path(__file__).parent / "data" / "language_format.csv"` (package-relative)
       b) `Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data" / "language_format.csv"` (project-root-relative)
     - If no CSV is found, return an empty dict so smart detection (step 2) can still handle it.

% Dependencies
  <get_language>
    <include>context/get_language_example.py</include>
  </get_language>

  <agentic_langtest>
    <include>context/agentic_langtest_example.py</include>
  </agentic_langtest>

% Data Source
  The file at `data/language_format.csv` (relative to package root) is a CSV with columns:
  - `extension` (e.g., .py, .ts, .go)
  - `run_test_command` (e.g., "python -m pytest {file} -v", empty for smart detection)
  - (Other columns like `language`, `comment`, `run_command` exist but are not primary for this task)

% Instructions
  - Use the `csv` module to read the data file.
  - Use `pathlib.Path` for file path operations.
  - Extract the file extension from the test file path to perform CSV lookup.
  - When replacing `{file}` placeholder, use the original test_file string as provided.
  - Include docstrings for all public functions.
  - Call `default_verify_cmd_for()` with the language in lowercase.
