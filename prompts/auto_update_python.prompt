write a function "auto_update" to automatically check to see if there is a new version of the pdd package, first parameter is package name, default to "pdd-cli", second parameter is the latest version, default to None, if there is new version, prompt the user to upgrade with the complete pip install command, if there is no new version, do not output anything, compare version using semantic versioning, be sure to ask for user's confirmation before upgrading
