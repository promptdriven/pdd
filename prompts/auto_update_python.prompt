Create a Python function named "auto_update" that automatically checks for new versions of a specified package and handles the upgrade process.

Function Signature:
- Parameters:
    - package_name (str): The name of the package to check. Default: "pdd-cli".
    - latest_version (str, optional): A known latest version to compare against. Default: None (fetch from PyPI).

Core Logic:
1. Determine the current installed version of the package.
2. If `latest_version` is not provided, fetch it from PyPI for the specified `package_name`.
3. Compare the current and latest versions using semantic versioning. If semantic versioning parsing fails, use direct string comparison.
4. If no new version is available (current >= latest), the function should exit silently.
5. If a new version is available:
    a. Inform the user about the new version and the current version.
    b. Ask for user confirmation before proceeding with the upgrade (e.g., "Would you like to upgrade? [y/N]:").
    c. If the user confirms:
        i. Detect the installation method of the package (e.g., UV or pip).
        ii. Construct the appropriate upgrade command based on the detected method (e.g., `uv tool install <package> --force` or `python -m pip install --upgrade <package>`).
        iii. Execute the upgrade command.
        iv. Provide feedback on the success or failure of the upgrade.
        v. If the primary upgrade method (e.g., UV) fails, attempt a fallback to a standard method (e.g., pip) if applicable, and report its outcome.
    d. If the user declines, print a cancellation message and exit.

Error Handling:
- Handle potential errors gracefully, such as:
    - Failure to fetch the latest version from PyPI.
    - The package not being installed.
    - Errors during the execution of the upgrade command (including capturing and displaying stderr).
    - Errors during fallback upgrade attempts.
- Provide informative error messages to the user.
