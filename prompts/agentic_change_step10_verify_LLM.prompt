% You are an expert software engineer using Prompt-Driven Development (PDD). Your task is to verify that the prompt changes made in the previous step are valid and complete.

% Context

You are working on step 10 of 10 in an agentic change workflow. Previous step implemented the prompt changes. This is the final verification before the user reviews.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Worktree Path: {worktree_path}
- Files to Stage: {files_to_stage}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Previous Step Output
<step9_output>
{step9_output}
</step9_output>

% Your Task

1. **Verify prompt syntax**
   - Check each modified/created prompt for syntax errors
   - Ensure `<include>` directives reference existing files
   - Verify prompt structure follows PDD conventions

2. **Verify prompt content**
   - Requirements are testable and behavioral
   - Dependencies are correctly specified
   - No implementation details leaked into prompts
   - Prompt size is appropriate (10-30% of expected code)

3. **Verify completeness**
   - All changes from Step 8 analysis were implemented
   - No files were missed
   - Example files updated if interfaces changed

4. **Dry-run validation** (optional)
   - If possible, run `pdd generate --dry-run` on modified prompts
   - Check for preprocessing errors

5. **Prepare for review**
   - Stage the changed files in git
   - Summarize what the user needs to review
   - Provide next steps

% Output

After completing your verification, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

**If verification passed:**
```markdown
## Step 10: Verification Complete

**Status:** All Checks Passed

### Verification Results
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Prompt syntax | :white_check_mark: Valid |
| Include directives | :white_check_mark: All files exist |
| PDD conventions | :white_check_mark: Followed |
| Completeness | :white_check_mark: All changes applied |

### Files Ready for Review
- `prompts/xxx_python.prompt` - [brief description of changes]
- `prompts/yyy_python.prompt` - [brief description of changes]

### Worktree Location
```
{worktree_path}
```

### Next Steps for User
1. Review the changes in the worktree
2. Run `pdd sync <module>` to regenerate code from modified prompts
3. Run tests to verify functionality
4. Merge the worktree branch when satisfied

### Commands to Run
```bash
cd {worktree_path}
pdd sync xxx  # Regenerate code for modified module
pytest tests/test_xxx.py  # Run tests
```

---
*Investigation complete. Ready for user review.*
```

**If verification failed (STOP workflow):**
```markdown
## Step 10: Verification Complete

**Status:** FAIL: Verification Failed

### Verification Results
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Prompt syntax | :x: [error details] |
| Include directives | :white_check_mark: Valid |
| ... | ... |

### Issues Found
1. [Issue description]
2. [Issue description]

### Recommendation
[How to fix the issues]

---
*Investigation paused - verification failed.*
```

% Important

- Be thorough in verification
- If any check fails, STOP the workflow
- Provide clear next steps for the user
- The user will manually run `pdd sync` - don't do it automatically
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
