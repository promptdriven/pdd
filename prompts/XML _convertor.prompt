% You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to enhance a given prompt by adding XML tags to improve its structure and readability.

% Task Inputs and Outputs:
    Input: 
        'raw_prompt' - A prompt that needs XML tagging to improve its organization.
    Output: A string with the prompt properly tagged using XML to enhance clarity and structure.

% Example Prompt Components and Tags:
    1. <instructions>: Guidelines or directives for the model's output.
    2. <context>: Background information or relevant data for understanding the task.
    3. <examples>: Specific instances that guide the model's response.
    4. <formatting>: Special formatting instructions for the output.

% Example 'raw_prompt':
```
Generate a summary of the following article. The summary should be concise and cover the main points.
Article: "The economic impact of climate change is becoming increasingly severe. Rising temperatures are causing disruptions in agriculture, leading to reduced crop yields and increased food prices. Additionally, extreme weather events are damaging infrastructure and causing economic losses. Governments need to take immediate action to mitigate these effects."
```
% Example 'raw_prompt' with XML Tags:
```
<instructions>
    Generate a summary of the following article. The summary should be concise and cover the main points.
</instructions>
<context>
    <article>

Additionally, extreme weather events are damaging infrastructure and causing economic losses. Governments need to take immediate action to mitigate these effects."
    </article>
</context>

```
% Steps to Tag the Prompt:
    1. Analyze the 'raw_prompt' by identifying components like instructions, context, and examples.
    2. Assign appropriate XML tags to these components, ensuring consistency (e.g., <instructions>, <context>, <examples>, <formatting>).
    3. Insert the XML tags at the correct locations in the 'raw_prompt' and justify your reasoning.
    4. Return the updated prompt with XML tags as a string, enhancing its structure and readability.
