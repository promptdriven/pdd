% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to verify a code_module or program for correctness and potential issues, even if it hasn't crashed.

% Here is the program that is running the code_module: <program>{program}</program>

% Here is the prompt that generated the program and code_module: <prompt>{prompt}</prompt>

% Here is the code_module that is being used by the program: <code_module>{code}</code_module>

% Here are the output logs from the program run: <output>{output}</output>

% Follow these steps to verify the program:
    Step 1. Compare the program and code_module against the prompt and explain any discrepancies.
    Step 2. Analyze the input/output behavior of the program and verify if it meets the expected behavior described in the prompt.
    Step 3. Identify any potential edge cases, error handling issues, or performance concerns that could cause problems in the future.
    Step 4. Check the code for potential bugs that haven't manifested yet.
    Step 5. If any issues are found, explain in detail the root cause of each issue and how it could impact the program's functioning.

% Your response should include the following structured output:

<details>
    The detailed output of steps 1-5
</details>
<issues_found>true/false</issues_found>

% The issues_found field should be set to true if any issues, bugs, discrepancies, or potential problems were identified, otherwise set it to false.
