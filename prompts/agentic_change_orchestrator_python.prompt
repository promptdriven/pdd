% Goal
Write the `pdd/agentic_change_orchestrator.py` module.

% Role & Scope
Orchestrator for the 9-step agentic change workflow. Runs each step as a separate agentic task, accumulates context between steps, and tracks overall progress and cost.

% Requirements
1. Function: `run_agentic_change_orchestrator(issue_url: str, issue_content: str, repo_owner: str, repo_name: str, issue_number: int, issue_author: str, issue_title: str, *, cwd: Path, verbose: bool = False, quiet: bool = False) -> Tuple[bool, str, float, str, List[str]]`
2. Return 5-tuple: (success, final_message, total_cost, model_used, changed_files)
3. Run 9 steps sequentially, each as a separate `run_agentic_task()` call
4. Accumulate step outputs to pass as context to subsequent steps
5. Track total cost across all steps
6. For Step 8: Parse agent output for `FILES_CREATED: path1, path2` or `FILES_MODIFIED: path1, path2` lines to extract changed files
7. Pass extracted files to Step 9 via `files_to_stage` context variable

% Step Execution
For each step (1-9):
1. Load the step prompt template via `load_prompt_template(f"agentic_change_step{n}_{name}_LLM")`
2. Format template with: issue_url, repo_owner, repo_name, issue_number, issue_content, issue_author, step1_output, step2_output, etc.
3. Call `run_agentic_task(formatted_prompt, cwd, ..., timeout=CHANGE_STEP_TIMEOUTS.get(step_num))`
   - Import `CHANGE_STEP_TIMEOUTS` from `agentic_common` (Issue #239)
   - Pass step-specific timeout to ensure complex steps get adequate time
4. Store the output for use by subsequent steps
5. Accumulate cost: `total_cost += step_cost`

% Step Sequence
| Step | Template Name | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | agentic_change_step1_duplicate_LLM | Search for duplicate issues |
| 2 | agentic_change_step2_docs_LLM | Check if already implemented |
| 3 | agentic_change_step3_research_LLM | Research to clarify specifications |
| 4 | agentic_change_step4_clarify_LLM | Verify requirements are clear, ask questions if not |
| 5 | agentic_change_step5_docs_change_LLM | Analyze documentation changes needed |
| 6 | agentic_change_step6_devunits_LLM | Identify dev units involved |
| 7 | agentic_change_step7_analyze_LLM | Analyze how prompts should change |
| 8 | agentic_change_step8_implement_LLM | Implement the prompt changes |
| 9 | agentic_change_step9_verify_LLM | Verify the changes |

% Context Accumulation
- Step 1 receives: issue_content
- Step 2 receives: issue_content, step1_output
- Step 3 receives: issue_content, step1_output, step2_output
- Step 4 receives: issue_content, step1_output, step2_output, step3_output, issue_author
- Step 5 receives: issue_content, step1_output through step4_output
- Step 6 receives: issue_content, step1_output through step5_output
- Step 7 receives: issue_content, step1_output through step6_output
- Step 8 receives: issue_content, step6_output, step7_output, worktree_path
- Step 9 receives: issue_content, step8_output, worktree_path, files_to_stage

% Files to Stage
After Step 8 parses FILES_CREATED/FILES_MODIFIED, pass the extracted file list to Step 9:
- `context["files_to_stage"] = ", ".join(changed_files)`
- This ensures Step 9 knows exactly which files to stage for review

% Early Exit Conditions (Hard Stops)

The orchestrator must parse step output to detect stop conditions:

| Step | Stop Condition | Detection |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Issue is a duplicate | Output contains "Duplicate of #" |
| 2 | Already implemented | Output contains "Already Implemented" |
| 3 | Research complete | (no stop condition - continues to step 4) |
| 4 | Clarification needed | Output contains "Clarification Needed" |
| 5 | Docs analysis complete | (no stop condition - continues to step 6) |
| 6 | No dev units found | Output contains "No Dev Units Found" |
| 7 | No changes needed | Output contains "No Changes Required" |
| 8 | Implementation failed | No FILES_CREATED or FILES_MODIFIED line, or output contains "FAIL:" |
| 9 | Verification failed | Output contains "FAIL: Verification" |

**Hard stop behavior:**
- Return `(False, "Stopped at step N: {reason}", total_cost, model_used, changed_files)`
- The step has already posted its findings to GitHub before returning
- Do NOT continue to subsequent steps

**Soft failures (continue):**
- If `run_agentic_task()` returns `(False, ...)` but does NOT match a hard stop condition: log warning and continue
- Steps should post their findings to GitHub even on partial failure

% Git Worktree Isolation

Before Step 8, create an isolated git worktree for prompt changes. This prevents the workflow from disturbing the user's current branch.

1. Helper function: `_setup_worktree(cwd: Path, issue_number: int, quiet: bool) -> Tuple[Optional[Path], Optional[str]]`
   - Create worktree at `.pdd/worktrees/change-issue-{issue_number}/` relative to git root
   - Branch name: `change/issue-{issue_number}`
   - If worktree already exists at path, remove with `git worktree remove --force`
   - If directory exists but is NOT a worktree, remove with `shutil.rmtree()`
   - If branch already exists locally, delete with `git branch -D`
   - Create worktree: `git worktree add -b {branch} {path} HEAD`
   - Return (worktree_path, None) on success, (None, error_msg) on failure

2. In orchestrator loop, before Step 8:
   - Call `_setup_worktree(cwd, issue_number, quiet)`
   - If worktree creation fails, return early with error: `(False, "Failed to create worktree: {error}", ...)`
   - Switch working directory to worktree path for Steps 8-9
   - Add `worktree_path` to context dict (for Step 8 and 9 prompt formatting)
   - Print: `"[blue]Working in worktree: {worktree_path}[/blue]"` (unless quiet)

3. Additional helper functions:
   - `_get_git_root(cwd: Path) -> Optional[Path]` - Get repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
   - `_worktree_exists(cwd: Path, worktree_path: Path) -> bool` - Check if path is in `git worktree list --porcelain` output
   - `_branch_exists(cwd: Path, branch: str) -> bool` - Check via `git show-ref --verify refs/heads/{branch}`
   - `_remove_worktree(cwd: Path, worktree_path: Path) -> Tuple[bool, str]` - Remove via `git worktree remove --force`
   - `_delete_branch(cwd: Path, branch: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]` - Delete via `git branch -D`

% Console Output

The orchestrator must provide real-time feedback to the user via rich console output:

1. **Header** (at start):
   ```
   Implementing change for issue #{issue_number}: "{issue_title}"
   ```

2. **Step progress** (before each step):
   ```
   [Step N/9] {step_description}...
   ```

3. **Agentic output** (during each step):
   - Stream or display the output from `run_agentic_task()` so the user can see what the agent is doing
   - Use `verbose` flag to control detail level

4. **Step result** (after each step):
   ```
     -> {brief_result}
   ```
   Examples: "No duplicates found", "3 dev units identified", "Changes applied"

5. **Hard stop message** (if workflow terminates early):
   ```
   Investigation stopped at Step N: {reason}
   ```

6. **Final summary** (at end):
   ```
   Change workflow complete  (or Change workflow failed)
      Total cost: ${total_cost:.4f}
      Files changed: {comma_separated_list}
      Worktree: {worktree_path}

   Next steps:
      cd {worktree_path}
      pdd sync <module>  # Regenerate code
   ```

Use `quiet` flag to suppress all output except errors. Use `verbose` flag to show full agentic task output.
