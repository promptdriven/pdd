% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write the `pdd/agentic_change_orchestrator.py` module.

% Role & Scope
Orchestrator for the 12-step agentic change workflow. Runs each step as a separate agentic task, accumulates context between steps, tracks overall progress and cost, and supports resuming from saved state. Includes a review loop (steps 10-11) that iterates until no issues are found.

% Requirements
1. Function: `run_agentic_change_orchestrator(issue_url: str, issue_content: str, repo_owner: str, repo_name: str, issue_number: int, issue_author: str, issue_title: str, *, cwd: Path, verbose: bool = False, quiet: bool = False, timeout_adder: float = 0.0) -> Tuple[bool, str, float, str, List[str]]`
2. Return 5-tuple: (success, final_message, total_cost, model_used, changed_files)
3. Run 12 steps, with steps 10-11 in a review loop (max 5 iterations)
4. Accumulate step outputs to pass as context to subsequent steps
5. Track total cost across all steps
6. For Step 9: Parse agent output for `FILES_CREATED: path1, path2` or `FILES_MODIFIED: path1, path2` lines to extract changed files
7. Pass extracted files to subsequent steps via `files_to_stage` context variable
8. **State Persistence**: Save step outputs to state file after each step completes
9. **Step Resumption**: On start, load saved state and skip steps that have already completed
10. **Review Loop**: Steps 10-11 repeat until step 10 outputs "No Issues Found" (max 5 iterations)

% Per-Step Timeouts
Define locally (workflow-specific configuration stays with the workflow):
```python
CHANGE_STEP_TIMEOUTS: Dict[int, float] = {
    1: 240.0,   # Duplicate Check
    2: 240.0,   # Docs Comparison
    3: 340.0,   # Research
    4: 340.0,   # Clarify
    5: 340.0,   # Docs Changes
    6: 340.0,   # Identify Dev Units
    7: 340.0,   # Architecture Review
    8: 600.0,   # Analyze Prompt Changes (Complex)
    9: 1000.0,  # Implement Changes (Most Complex)
    10: 340.0,  # Identify Issues
    11: 600.0,  # Fix Issues (Complex)
    12: 340.0,  # Create PR
}
```

% Step Execution
For steps 1-9 and 12:
1. **Check if step already completed** (from saved state) - if so, skip and use cached output
2. Load the step prompt template via `load_prompt_template(f"agentic_change_step{n}_{name}_LLM")`
3. Format template with: issue_url, repo_owner, repo_name, issue_number, issue_content, issue_author, step1_output, step2_output, etc.
4. Call `run_agentic_task(formatted_prompt, cwd, ..., timeout=CHANGE_STEP_TIMEOUTS.get(step_num, 340.0) + timeout_adder)`
   - Use step-specific timeout plus optional timeout_adder to allow caller to extend timeouts
5. Store the output for use by subsequent steps
6. **Save state to file** after step completes (for resumption)
7. Accumulate cost: `total_cost += step_cost`

% Review Loop (Steps 10-11)
Steps 10 and 11 form a review loop that repeats until no issues are found:

```python
review_iteration = 0
MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS = 5
previous_fixes = ""

while review_iteration < MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS:
    review_iteration += 1

    # Step 10: Identify Issues
    step10_output = run_step_10(review_iteration, previous_fixes)

    if "No Issues Found" in step10_output:
        break  # Exit loop, proceed to step 12

    # Step 11: Fix Issues
    step11_output = run_step_11(step10_output, review_iteration)
    previous_fixes += f"\n\nIteration {review_iteration}:\n{step11_output}"

if review_iteration >= MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS:
    # Warn but continue to PR creation
    print("Warning: Maximum review iterations reached")
```

Context for review loop:
- Step 10 receives: files_to_stage, worktree_path, step9_output, review_iteration, previous_fixes
- Step 11 receives: step10_output, worktree_path, review_iteration

% Step Sequence
| Step | Template Name | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | agentic_change_step1_duplicate_LLM | Search for duplicate issues |
| 2 | agentic_change_step2_docs_LLM | Check if already implemented |
| 3 | agentic_change_step3_research_LLM | Research to clarify specifications |
| 4 | agentic_change_step4_clarify_LLM | Verify requirements are clear, ask questions if not |
| 5 | agentic_change_step5_docs_change_LLM | Analyze documentation changes needed |
| 6 | agentic_change_step6_devunits_LLM | Identify dev units involved |
| 7 | agentic_change_step7_architecture_LLM | Review architecture, ask questions if decisions needed |
| 8 | agentic_change_step8_analyze_LLM | Analyze how prompts should change |
| 9 | agentic_change_step9_implement_LLM | Implement the prompt changes |
| 10 | agentic_change_step10_identify_issues_LLM | Identify issues with prompts/docs (loop start) |
| 11 | agentic_change_step11_fix_issues_LLM | Fix identified issues (loop end) |
| 12 | agentic_change_step12_create_pr_LLM | Create PR and link to issue |

% Context Accumulation
- Step 1 receives: issue_content
- Step 2 receives: issue_content, step1_output
- Step 3 receives: issue_content, step1_output, step2_output
- Step 4 receives: issue_content, step1_output, step2_output, step3_output, issue_author
- Step 5 receives: issue_content, step1_output through step4_output
- Step 6 receives: issue_content, step1_output through step5_output
- Step 7 receives: issue_content, step1_output through step6_output, issue_author
- Step 8 receives: issue_content, step1_output through step7_output
- Step 9 receives: issue_content, step7_output, step8_output, worktree_path
- Step 10 receives: issue_content, step9_output, worktree_path, files_to_stage, review_iteration, previous_fixes
- Step 11 receives: issue_content, step10_output, worktree_path, review_iteration
- Step 12 receives: issue_content, step8_output, worktree_path, files_to_stage, issue_title

% Files to Stage
After Step 9 parses FILES_CREATED/FILES_MODIFIED, pass the extracted file list to subsequent steps:
- `context["files_to_stage"] = ", ".join(changed_files)`
- Step 10 uses this to know which files to review
- Step 12 uses this to know which files to commit

% Early Exit Conditions (Hard Stops)

The orchestrator must parse step output to detect stop conditions:

| Step | Stop Condition | Detection |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Issue is a duplicate | Output contains "Duplicate of #" |
| 2 | Already implemented | Output contains "Already Implemented" |
| 3 | Research complete | (no stop condition - continues to step 4) |
| 4 | Clarification needed | Output contains "Clarification Needed" |
| 5 | Docs analysis complete | (no stop condition - continues to step 6) |
| 6 | No dev units found | Output contains "No Dev Units Found" |
| 7 | Architectural decision needed | Output contains "Architectural Decision Needed" |
| 8 | No changes needed | Output contains "No Changes Required" |
| 9 | Implementation failed | No FILES_CREATED or FILES_MODIFIED line, or output contains "FAIL:" |
| 10 | Issues found | (not a hard stop - loops to step 11) |
| 10 | No issues found | Output contains "No Issues Found" (exits loop, continues to step 12) |
| 11 | Fixes applied | (not a hard stop - loops back to step 10) |
| 12 | PR created | (workflow complete) |

**Hard stop behavior:**
- Return `(False, "Stopped at step N: {reason}", total_cost, model_used, changed_files)`
- The step has already posted its findings to GitHub before returning
- Do NOT continue to subsequent steps

**Soft failures (continue):**
- If `run_agentic_task()` returns `(False, ...)` but does NOT match a hard stop condition: log warning and continue
- Steps should post their findings to GitHub even on partial failure

% Git Worktree Isolation

Before Step 9, create an isolated git worktree for prompt changes. This prevents the workflow from disturbing the user's current branch.

1. Helper function: `_setup_worktree(cwd: Path, issue_number: int, quiet: bool) -> Tuple[Optional[Path], Optional[str]]`
   - Create worktree at `.pdd/worktrees/change-issue-{issue_number}/` relative to git root
   - Branch name: `change/issue-{issue_number}`
   - If worktree already exists at path, remove with `git worktree remove --force`
   - If directory exists but is NOT a worktree, remove with `shutil.rmtree()`
   - If branch already exists locally, delete with `git branch -D`
   - Create worktree: `git worktree add -b {branch} {path} HEAD`
   - Return (worktree_path, None) on success, (None, error_msg) on failure

2. In orchestrator loop, before Step 9:
   - Call `_setup_worktree(cwd, issue_number, quiet)`
   - If worktree creation fails, return early with error: `(False, "Failed to create worktree: {error}", ...)`
   - Switch working directory to worktree path for Steps 9-12
   - Add `worktree_path` to context dict (for Steps 9-12 prompt formatting)
   - Print: `"[blue]Working in worktree: {worktree_path}[/blue]"` (unless quiet)

3. Additional helper functions:
   - `_get_git_root(cwd: Path) -> Optional[Path]` - Get repo root via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
   - `_worktree_exists(cwd: Path, worktree_path: Path) -> bool` - Check if path is in `git worktree list --porcelain` output
   - `_branch_exists(cwd: Path, branch: str) -> bool` - Check via `git show-ref --verify refs/heads/{branch}`
   - `_remove_worktree(cwd: Path, worktree_path: Path) -> Tuple[bool, str]` - Remove via `git worktree remove --force`
   - `_delete_branch(cwd: Path, branch: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]` - Delete via `git branch -D`

% Console Output

The orchestrator must provide real-time feedback to the user via rich console output:

1. **Header** (at start):
   ```
   Implementing change for issue #{issue_number}: "{issue_title}"
   ```

2. **Step progress** (before each step):
   ```
   [Step N/12] {step_description}...
   ```
   For review loop iterations:
   ```
   [Step 10/12] Identifying issues (iteration 2/5)...
   [Step 11/12] Fixing issues (iteration 2/5)...
   ```

3. **Agentic output** (during each step):
   - Stream or display the output from `run_agentic_task()` so the user can see what the agent is doing
   - Use `verbose` flag to control detail level

4. **Step result** (after each step):
   ```
     -> {brief_result}
   ```
   Examples: "No duplicates found", "3 dev units identified", "Changes applied"

5. **Hard stop message** (if workflow terminates early):
   ```
   Investigation stopped at Step N: {reason}
   ```

6. **Final summary** (at end):
   ```
   Change workflow complete
      Total cost: ${total_cost:.4f}
      Files changed: {comma_separated_list}
      PR: {pr_url}
      Review iterations: {N}

   Next steps:
      1. Review and merge the PR
      2. Run `pdd sync <module>` after merge
   ```

Use `quiet` flag to suppress all output except errors. Use `verbose` flag to show full agentic task output.

% State Persistence (Step Resumption)

To avoid re-running completed steps when the workflow is paused (e.g., for clarification or architectural decisions), implement state persistence:

1. **State file location**: `.pdd/change-state/issue-{issue_number}.json`

2. **State file structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "issue_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123",
     "issue_number": 123,
     "last_completed_step": 4,
     "step_outputs": {
       "1": "Step 1 output...",
       "2": "Step 2 output...",
       "3": "Step 3 output...",
       "4": "Step 4 output..."
     },
     "total_cost": 0.0234,
     "model_used": "anthropic",
     "worktree_path": null
   }
   ```

3. **Helper functions**:
   - `_get_state_file_path(cwd: Path, issue_number: int) -> Path` - Returns state file path
   - `_load_state(cwd: Path, issue_number: int) -> Optional[Dict]` - Load existing state or return None
   - `_save_state(cwd: Path, issue_number: int, state: Dict) -> None` - Save state to file
   - `_clear_state(cwd: Path, issue_number: int) -> None` - Delete state file when workflow completes

4. **Orchestrator logic**:
   - On start: Load state, determine `start_step = last_completed_step + 1`
   - If state exists: Print `"Resuming from step {start_step} (steps 1-{last_completed_step} cached)"`
   - For steps < start_step: Use cached output from `state["step_outputs"]`
   - For steps >= start_step: Execute normally, save state after each
   - On successful completion (step 12 completes): Clear state file
   - On hard stop (e.g., clarification needed): State remains for next run
   - Review loop state: Store current iteration count in state file

5. **Console output for resumption**:
   ```
   Resuming change workflow for issue #123
      Steps 1-4 already complete (cached)
      Starting from Step 5: Documentation Changes
   ```

% Error Handling
- Return `(False, "Failed to create worktree: {error}", cost, model, [])` if worktree setup fails
- Return `(False, "Stopped at step N: {reason}", cost, model, changed_files)` on hard stop conditions
- Log warning and continue if `run_agentic_task()` returns failure without matching a hard stop condition
- On state file read/write errors, log warning and continue without persistence
