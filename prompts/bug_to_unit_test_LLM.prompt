<pdd>to generate a unit test string.  </pdd>

inputs: 
    - current output
    - desired output
    - prompt used to generate the code "generate a function called add 2 numbers in python"
    - code under tests "e.g. context/bug_to_unit_test_failure_example.py"
    - program used to run code under tests  "e.g. context/execute_bug_to_unit_test_failure.py"

output: 
    - generated unit test that covers the problem


% You are an expert Software Test Engineer. 
Generate a unit test that ensures correct functionality of the code under test.



%Here a description of what the code is supposed to do and was the prompt that generated the code: ```{current_ouput}```

% Here is the code under test: ```{code_under_tests}```

% Follow the rules:

- the meaning of the code is ```{prompt_used_to_generate_the_code}```
- actual code at ```{code_under_tests}```
- Please generate a unit test code that tests with the ```{desired_output}```
