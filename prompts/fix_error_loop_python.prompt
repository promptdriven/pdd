% You are an expert Python Software Engineer. Your goal is to write a Python function, "fix_error_loop", that will attempt to fix errors in a unit test and its corresponding code file through multiple iterations.

<include>context/python_preamble.prompt</include>

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Inputs: 
        'unit_test_file' - A string containing the path to the unit test file.
        'code_file' - A string containing the path to the code file being tested.
        'prompt' - A string containing the prompt that generated the code under test.
        'verification_program' - A string containing the path to a Python program that verifies if the code still runs correctly.
        'strength' - A float between 0 and 1 that represents the strength of the LLM model to use.
        'temperature' - A float that represents the temperature parameter for the LLM model.
        'max_attempts' - An integer representing the maximum number of fix attempts before giving up.
        'budget' - A float representing the maximum cost allowed for the fixing process.
        'error_log_file' - A string containing the path to the error log file (default: "error_log.txt").
    Outputs:
        'success' - A boolean indicating whether the errors were successfully fixed.
        'final_unit_test' - A string containing the contents of the final unit test file.
        'final_code' - A string containing the contents of the final code file.
        'total_attempts' - An integer representing the number of fix attempts made.
        'total_cost' - A float representing the total cost of all fix attempts.
        'model_name' - A string representing the name of the LLM model used.

% Here are examples of how to use internal modules:
<internal_example_modules>
    % Here is an example of the fix_errors_from_unit_tests function that will be used: <fix_errors_from_unit_tests_example><include>context/fix_errors_from_unit_tests_example.py</include></fix_errors_from_unit_tests_example>
</internal_example_modules>

% Here are examples of lines in the pytest -vv output for fails and errors:
```=================== 4 failed, 2 passed, 4 warnings in 1.47s ====================
=================== 2 failed, 4 passed, 4 warnings in 1.36s ====================
================================================== 1 error, 1 failed in 0.46s ===================================================
================================================== 1 error in 0.5s ===================================================
======================== 16 failed, 6 warnings in 2.06s ========================```

% This function will do the following:
    Step 1. Remove the existing error log file specified by 'error_log_file' if it exists.
    Step 2. Initialize variables:
        - Counter for the number of attempts
        - Total cost accumulator
        - Best iteration tracker (This is so that in case not all issues are solved, the iteration with the lowest errors get restored. In case there are iterations with the same number errors, then the iteration with the lowest fails will get restored.)
    Step 3. Enter a while loop that continues until max_attempts is reached or budget is exceeded:
        a. Run the unit_test_file with 'python -m pytest -vv' and pipe all output appended to the specified error log file.
        b. If the test passes, break the loop.
        c. If the test fails:
           - Read and print the error message from the error log file, but be sure to escape square brackets first so rprint doesn't misinterpret them as a command.
           - Extract the number of fails and errors from pytest -vv stdout.
           - Create backup copies of the unit_test_file and code_file, appending the number of fails, errors, and the current iteration number to the filenames like this "unit_test_1_0_3.py" and "code_1_0_3.py", where there was one fail, zero errors and it is the third iteration through the loop.
           - Read the contents of the unit_test_file and code_file.
           - Call fix_errors_from_unit_tests with the file contents, error from the error log file, the error log file, and the provided strength and temperature.
           - Add the returned total_cost to the total cost accumulator.
           - If the total cost exceeds the budget, break the loop.
           - If both updated_unit_test and updated_code are False, break the loop as no changes were needed.
           - If updated_unit_test is True, write the fixed_unit_test back to the unit_test_file.           
           - If updated_code is True:
              * Write the fixed_code back to the code_file.
              * Run the verification_program to check if the code still runs.
              * If the verification fails, restore the original file from the backup and continue the loop.
              * If the verification succeeds, update the best iteration tracker if this iteration has fewer errors or fails.
        d. Increment the attempt counter.
    Step 4. After the loop ends, run pytest one last time, pipe the output to the error log file, escape square brackets and print it to the console.
    Step 5. If the last run isn't the best iteration, copy back the files from the best iteration.
    Step 6. Return the success status, final unit test contents, final code contents, total number of attempts, and total cost.
