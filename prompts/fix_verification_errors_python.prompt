% You are an expert Python Software Engineer. Your goal is to write a python function, "fix_verification_errors", that will fix issues in a code module identified during verification.

<include>context/python_preamble.prompt</include>

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Inputs:
        'program' - A string containing the program code that was running the code module.
        'prompt' - A string containing the prompt that generated the code module.
        'code' - A string containing the code module to be fixed.
        'output' - A string containing the output logs from the program run.
        'strength' - A float between 0 and 1 that is the strength of the LLM model to use.
        'temperature' - A float that is the temperature of the LLM model to use. Default is 0.
        'verbose' - A boolean that indicates whether to print out the details of the function. Default is False.
    Outputs:
        'explanation': List of issues found and their explanations (if any).
        'fixed_program' - A string that is the fixed program.
        'fixed_code' - A string that is the fixed code module.
        'total_cost' - A float that is the total cost of the run.
        'model_name' - A string that is the name of the selected LLM model.

% Here is how to use the internal modules:
    <internal_modules>
        % For loading prompt templates:
        <load_prompt_template_example>
            <include>context/load_prompt_template_example.py</include>
        </load_prompt_template_example>

        % For running prompts with llm_invoke:
        <llm_invoke_example>
            <include>context/llm_invoke_example.py</include>
        </llm_invoke_example>

        % For using edit_file to make changes:
        <edit_file_example>
            <include>context/edit_file_example.py</include>
        </edit_file_example>
    </internal_modules>

% This program will do the following:
    Step 1. Load the 'find_verification_errors_LLM' and 'fix_verification_errors_LLM' prompt templates.
    Step 2. Run the code through the model using llm_invoke with the provided strength and temperature to identify issues. 
        2a. Pass the following string parameters to the 'find_verification_errors_LLM' prompt during invoke:
            - 'program'
            - 'prompt'
            - 'code'
            - 'output'
        2b. If verbose is True, pretty print a message letting the user know it is running and how many tokens are in the prompt and the cost.
    Step 3. If verbose is True, pretty print the markdown formatting that is present in the result via the rich Markdown function. Also pretty print the number of tokens in the result and the cost.
    Step 4. Analyze the verification result to determine if issues were found.
        4a. Extract the value of the <issues_found> tag from the verification result, which will be either "true" or "false".
        4b. If <issues_found> is "false", set issues_found to False and return with default values for update_program (False), update_code (False), fixed_program (original program), and fixed_code (original code).
        4c. If <issues_found> is "true", set issues_found to True and proceed to Step 5. Also extract the <details> section to pass as the issues in Step 5.
    Step 5. Only if issues were found, run a second llm_invoke with the 'fix_verification_errors_LLM' prompt to generate fixes.
        5a. Pass the following string parameters to the prompt during invoke:
            - 'program': The original program
            - 'prompt': The original prompt
            - 'code': The original code module
            - 'output': The original output
            - 'issues': The verification result's <details> section containing identified issues
        5b. If verbose is True, pretty print a message letting the user know it is running and how many tokens are in the prompt and the cost.
    Step 6. Extract the following values from the fix result:
        - 'fixed_program'
        - 'fixed_code'
        - 'explanation'
    Step 7. If verbose is True, print the total cost of the run(s).
    Step 8. Use edit_file to make the changes to the program and code module according to the fixed_program and fixed_code extracted in Step 6.
    Step 9. Return explanation, fixed_program (from step 8), fixed_code (from step 8
    ), total_cost, and model_name.

% Ensure that the function handles potential issues gracefully, even when no critical errors have occurred but improvements are still possible.
