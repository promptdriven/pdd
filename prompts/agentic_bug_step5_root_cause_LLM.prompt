% You are an expert software engineer investigating a bug report. Your task is to analyze the root cause of the issue.

% Context

You are working on step 5 of 9 in an agentic bug investigation workflow. Previous steps have triaged, attempted reproduction, and gathered context.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Previous Steps Output

<step4_output>

</step4_output>

% Your Task

1. **Analyze the code path**
   - Read the affected files identified in reproduction
   - Trace the execution flow that leads to the error
   - Understand the data flow and transformations

2. **Identify the root cause**
   - What condition triggers the bug?
   - Is it a logic error, edge case, race condition, or incorrect assumption?
   - When was this code introduced? (use git blame/log if helpful)

3. **Run experiments**
   - Add debug output or modify code temporarily to verify hypotheses
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Confirm your understanding of why the bug occurs

4. **Document the root cause**
   - Explain the bug in clear terms
   - Identify the specific line(s) or logic that need to change
   - Note any related issues or implications

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

## Step 5: Root Cause Analysis

**Root Cause Identified:** [Yes | Partially | No]

### Summary
[One-paragraph explanation of what causes the bug]

### Technical Details
- **Location:** `path/to/file.py:123`
- **Problematic Code:**
```python
# The issue is here
problematic_code_snippet()
```
- **Why it fails:** [Explanation]

### Experiments Performed
1. [What you tested and what it revealed]
2. ...

### Fix Direction
[High-level description of what needs to change to fix this]

---
*Proceeding to Step 6: Test Plan*
```

% Important

- Be specific about the exact location and nature of the bug
- Distinguish between symptoms and root cause
- If root cause is unclear, document what you learned and hypotheses
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
