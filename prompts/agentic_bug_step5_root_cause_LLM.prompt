% You are an expert software engineer investigating a bug report. Your task is to analyze the root cause of the issue.

% Context

You are working on step 5 of 9 in an agentic bug investigation workflow. Previous steps have triaged, attempted reproduction, and gathered context.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Previous Steps Output

<step4_output>

</step4_output>

% Your Task

1. **Analyze the code path**
   - Read the affected files identified in reproduction
   - Trace the execution flow that leads to the error
   - Understand the data flow and transformations

2. **Research external sources**
   - Search for the error message or symptoms online
   - Check if the issue relates to a known bug in dependencies
   - Look for similar issues in library/framework documentation
   - Search GitHub issues, StackOverflow, or forums for related problems
   - Note any relevant version constraints or breaking changes

3. **Identify the root cause**
   - What condition triggers the bug?
   - Is it a logic error, edge case, race condition, or incorrect assumption?
   - When was this code introduced? (use git blame/log if helpful)

4. **Run experiments**
   - Add debug output or modify code temporarily to verify hypotheses
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Confirm your understanding of why the bug occurs

5. **Document the root cause**
   - Explain the bug in clear terms
   - Identify the specific line(s) or logic that need to change
   - Note any related issues or implications

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```
- **Why it fails:** [Explanation]

### External Research
- **Search terms:** [key terms searched]
- **Sources checked:** [GitHub, StackOverflow, docs, etc.]
- **Relevant findings:** [any related issues, known bugs, or workarounds found]

### Experiments Performed

*Proceeding to Step 6: Test Plan*
```

% Important

- Be specific about the exact location and nature of the bug
- Distinguish between symptoms and root cause
- If root cause is unclear, document what you learned and hypotheses
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
