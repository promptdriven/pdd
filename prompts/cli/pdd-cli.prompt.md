# Local authoring-kit CLI

Own `src/pdd-cli.mjs`; export `renderHelp(prefix)` and `runPdd(argv, dependencies)`. Help, version, completion and recipe discovery operate using public local files only. pdd prints no guide; the agent loads the pdd-prompting skill. Parse with `parseArgv` from the required argument-parser contract before reading skills or workflows; unsupported input gets a finite stderr diagnostic/exit2 and no private fallback.

Use the package-root metadata version. For `--version`, a linked local checkout is recognized only when `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (run with `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` ignored) equals `realpath(packageRoot)`. On a symbolic branch, print `<version>-dev.<branch>.<sha9>`; replace `/` in the branch with `-`. A detached HEAD, a package root that is not the Git top level, an npm-packed GitHub branch package, and the published release print the plain release version. Always print only that version followed by one newline, without the package name or any prefix. Then call [skills install](skills-install.prompt.md) `findSkills` with the same arguments as setup, and for each agent result whose `stale` is `'older'` print the stale line below to stderr (0.1.8 tester: no command showed that the installed skills were older than pdd). A failure of that check prints nothing and never changes the exit code. `workflow list` reads the bundled workflow areas only; it does not start work. Preserve stdout for successful values and stderr for errors. `setup` does two things, in this order. First it calls [skills install](skills-install.prompt.md) `setupSkills({packageRoot, cwd, home, claudeConfigDir})` with home from the HOME environment value (else `os.homedir()`) and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. For each agent result it prints `Updated N PDD skills in ROOT: NAMES` when it updated copies, then, when found, `PDD skills found in FOLDER`, or when `stale` is set the stale line `PDD skills in FOLDER are older than pdd VERSION. To update them, run: npx skills add promptdriven/pdd#alpha -g -a codex -a claude-code -y` (`differ from the skills of pdd VERSION` for `'differs'`; VERSION from the package metadata; leave out ` -g` when FOLDER is `<cwd>/.agents/skills` or `<cwd>/.claude/skills`). Print this `npx skills add` command, never `npx skills update`: update changes only skills that `npx skills add` recorded, and says "No global skills tracked" for copies that pdd setup or a person made (0.1.8 tester). `add` replaces any copy, and later `update` works too, else `Installed N PDD skills to ROOT: NAMES` when it copied any. NAMES are the skill folder names, joined by `, `, in the order of `PDD_SKILL_NAMES`. Use `skill` instead of `skills` when N is 1. An agent error prints `pdd setup: the PDD skills could not be installed in ROOT (REASON).` to stderr. Then it calls [project setup](project-setup.prompt.md) `setupProject({cwd, packageRoot})` and prints `Wrote the PDD block in FILE.` or `FILE already has this PDD block. No change.`; its error prints `pdd setup: ` and the message to stderr. Each part runs even when the other fails. Exit 1 if any part failed, else 0. No other command installs skills. pdd starts no chat itself outside `workflow run`. Keep imports and injection defaults self-contained, with no private transport/backend dependency.

For setup, version reporting and workflow startup, use [PATH diagnostics](path-diagnostic.prompt.md). Print the returned lines to stderr. Setup uses the full report; `--version` uses its conflict-only mode while stdout remains exactly the package version and newline; `workflow run` uses its compact shadowing warning before dispatch. Other commands, help and invalid syntax do not discover or probe PATH. A diagnostic failure must not prevent the requested command. No installer script is part of this package; setup is the supported install check.

For a `CommandInputError`, print its message once to stderr, leave stdout empty
and return its exitCode (2). Every line written to stdout or stderr ends with
one newline. Preserve other commands and their existing dispatch and effects.

## Dependencies

- [Argument parser](argument-parser.prompt.md) is required for authoring,
  generation, runtime, verification and testing: it owns command validation and
  exact input-error messages. The CLI owns only their stream and exit handling.

Read the entire [Prompting guide](../../docs/prompting-guide.md) before authoring prompts or Stories. Follow [public alpha boundary](public-boundary.prompt.md) for scope and the shared local command contract.

The runner routes (run, done, ask, approve, changes, cancel, status, open) call the matching export of `src/workflow-runner.mjs` (startRun, stepDone, askPerson, approveRun, changeRun, cancelRun, runStatus, openRun) with the parsed values, cwd and packageRoot. For startRun, pass `base` only when `--base` was given, using its text unchanged; the runner owns branch validation and selection. For status, pass `all`, `cancelled` and `json` only when their flag is given. Tests may inject the runner module. Print the returned message once: stdout when exitCode is 0, stderr otherwise. Return the exitCode. A missing export, an invalid reply or a thrown error prints one finite line and returns 1; never retry.

workflow list uses `listWorkflowAreas({packageRoot,cwd,home})` (home from the HOME environment value) and `formatWorkflowList` from [workflow areas](workflow-areas.prompt.md). A read failure returns 1. Local help/version/skill/completion do not import the runner.

## Help contract

The first help line is exactly `PDD: prompt-driven development for your coding agent.` Help lists the catalog forms, then says: `Open Codex or Claude as usual and call a PDD skill: $pdd-feature in Codex, /pdd-feature in Claude Code (also pdd-bug, pdd-small-change, pdd-prompting).` (Codex calls a skill with `$name`, Claude Code with `/name`); `workflow run` starts the first area chat in Herdr session pdd and exits; the person approves each area, and pdd pushes the branch and opens a real PR after the last step; pdd never merges. Help is exit 0 and local, with no runner, network or auth effects.

## Runtime commands

For the `prompt-approve` plan, import [prompt approve](prompt-approve.prompt.md) dynamically and return `runApprove({words, cwd}, {stdout, stderr})` unchanged.

For the `runtime-check` and `runtime-try` plans, import the [runtime client](runtime-client.prompt.md) dynamically and call `runCheck` or `runTry` with the operands, the options and cwd, plus stdout, stderr and the injected env. Return its exit code unchanged. The runtime client also owns local `check --lint --local` and `check --screen URL --drawing PATH`; dispatch them with the same operands, options, cwd and ports, without adding runtime authentication in this router. Help for check and try stays local. If the client throws, write `pdd stopped with an internal error. If it sent checks, read them with pdd check --read. Do not send them again.` to stderr and return 3, because checks may have been sent.

For `workflow-view`, dynamically import [read-only review](workflow-view.prompt.md) and call `viewRun({ref: operands[0], cwd})`. Print the result once (stdout on success, stderr on failure) and return its exit code. This route must not import the workflow runner, inspect Herdr, or execute PATH version probes.

Route workflow-evidence to workflow runner recordEvidence with issue ref and required --summary file path; missing summary is a CLI input error. It records evidence only, not workflow progression.

## Progress and unexpected errors

Pass the runner a `say` port that writes one line to stderr, so slow workflow steps show progress while stdout keeps the result. An unexpected error in a runner, runtime or view route keeps its fixed safe line and adds `Reason: <cleaned first line of the error>` (the [cause helper](runtime-output.prompt.md#progress-and-causes)), so the person sees what really failed.

## Try MCP transport and registration

For local `mcp`, dynamically import [Try MCP](try-mcp.prompt.md) and return `runMcp({cwd, env}, {stdin, stdout, stderr})`. Accept injected `mcpServer` for tests. This route performs no PATH diagnostics, skill checks or stdout chatter; stdout belongs exclusively to MCP. A startup error prints one finite cause to stderr and returns 1.

After setup's existing skills and project-block actions, dynamically import [agent MCP setup](agent-mcp-setup.prompt.md) and await `setupAgentMcp({env, packageRoot}, {stdin, stdout, stderr, confirm})`. Combine its failure with the existing exit status; preserve the earlier actions even if registration is declined or fails. Accept stdin (default process.stdin) and optional confirm as ports. Only registration is covered by its consent; the existing setup actions retain their behavior.
