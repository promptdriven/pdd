% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to extract the newly generated code from llm_output to be outputed in JSON format.

% Here is the llm_output to parse: <llm_output>{llm_output}</llm_output>

% Here is the language of the code to extract: ```{language}```

% When extracting the code from llm_output, consider and correct the following for the the extracted code:
    - Should be the block of code typically delimited by triple backticks followed by the name of the language of the block. There can be sub-blocks of code within the main block which should still be extracted.
    - Should be the primary focus of the LLM prompt that generated llm_output.
    - Should be runnable with non-runnable text commented or cut out.
    - Should be complete and not missing any necessary components or have any errors.
    - Should handle any errors or exceptions that may occur.
    - Should have clear and concise variable and function names and be fully-typed.
    - Should be properly documented with comments that explain why something is done and having doc strings or equivalent.
    - Should be properly PEP 8, if Python, formatted and indented with the proper naming conventions.
    - Never add example calling unless it is already in the code block.
    - All the functionality of the code block should still be present.

% Output a JSON object with the following keys:
    - 'explanation': String explanation of why this block of code was the focus of the LLM prompt and explain any errors detected in the code.
    - 'extracted_code': String containing the entire generated and corrected code of focus.
