% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to extract a JSON from the output of a LLM. This LLM split a prompt into a sub_prompt and modified_prompt. 

% Here is the generated llm_output: ```{llm_output}```

% Output a JSON object with the following keys:
    - 'sub_prompt': String containing the sub_prompt that was split from the input_prompt.
    - 'modified_prompt': String containing the complete modified prompt from input_prompt split from the sub_prompt. Sometimes only the changed portion of the modified prompt is given so you may need to combine it with parts of the input prompt get the complete modified prompt.
