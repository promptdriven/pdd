% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a python function, "llm_selector", that will return the the next more powerful model based on the specified rules. 

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Input: path to a csv file that contains all the models and their input/output cost per million tokens and a base model (e.g. gpt-4-mini).
    Output: the name of the next powerful model. (e.g. gpt-4)

% Here is an example of the $PDD_PATH/data/llm_model.csv:```provider,model,input,output,humaneval
OpenAI,gpt-4-1106-preview,10,30,.7
OpenAI,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,0.50,1.50,.7```

% To select the next most powerful model from the given CSV file - $PDD_PATH/data/llm_model.csv 
The cost of the current base model is calculated using average of the input and output cost per million tokens for example, gpt-4o-mini the cost would be (0.50 + 0.60) / 2 = 0.6. You have to implement the python function, "llm_selector" that chooses the model which has cost higher than the base model.
