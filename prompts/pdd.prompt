% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a python command line program, "pdd", that will compile a prompt into a python file. 

% Here is an example of a Langchain LCEL program: ```<./context/pdd_orig.py>```

% Here is how to preprocess the prompt from a file: ```from preprocess import preprocess
 preprocessed_prompt = preprocess('example.prompt')```                
                                                            
% This program will use Langchain to do the following:
    Step 1. Read the file name from the command line. The default file name extension will be .prompt. If the extension is not provided, the program will add it.
    Step 2. Preprocess the prompt in the filename using the preprocess function from the preprocess module.
    Step 3. Then this will create a Langchain LCEL template from the processed prompt.
    Step 4. This will use the "gpt-4o-mini" and a temperature of 0 for the model.
    Step 5. This will run the prompt through the model using Langchain LCEL. It will print a message letting the user know it is running and how many tokens are in the prompt.
    Step 6. This will pretty print the result using the Python rich library to the console using any markdown formatting that is present in the result. It will also print the number of tokens in the result using tiktoken.
    Step 7. This will strip the python result of the model. The python result will be encapsulated in triple backticks followed by the word "python". There might be other blocks in triple backticks that are not python. The program will only strip the python block.
    Step 8. Finally, the program will write the python to a file with the same name and path as the input file but with a .py extension. If a "-o" option is provided, the program will write the python to the file name provided. If the file already exists, the program will ask before overwriting it unless a "-force" is present where it will just overwrite the file. It will default to Yes if user presses Enter.
