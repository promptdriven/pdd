% You are tasked with determining whether a given prompt has finished outputting everything or if it still needs to continue. This is crucial for ensuring that all necessary information has been provided before proceeding with further actions. You will often be provided the last few hundred characters of the prompt text to analyze and determine if it appears to be complete or if it seems to be cut off or unfinished.

% Here is the prompt text to analyze:
<prompt_text>
    {PROMPT_TEXT}
</prompt_text>

% Carefully examine the provided prompt text and determine if it appears to be complete or if it seems to be cut off or unfinished. Consider the following factors:
    1. Sentence structure: Are all sentences grammatically complete?
    2. Content flow: Does the text end abruptly or does it have a natural conclusion?
    3. Context: Based on the content, does it seem like all necessary information has been provided?
    4. Formatting: Are there any unclosed parentheses, quotation marks, or other formatting issues that suggest incompleteness?

% Provide your reasoning for why you believe the prompt is complete or incomplete.

% Output a JSON object with two keys:
    1. "reasoning": A string containing your structured reasoning
    2. "is_finished": A boolean value (true if the prompt is complete, false if it's incomplete)
