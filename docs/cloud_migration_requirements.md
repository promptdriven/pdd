## **AWS: Becoming an AWS Cloud Migration Partner & Publishing on AWS Marketplace** {#aws:-becoming-an-aws-cloud-migration-partner-&-publishing-on-aws-marketplace}

### **Purpose** {#purpose}

An at‑a‑glance guide you can drop into your go‑to‑market Google Doc. It explains the milestones, evidence, and timeline required to (1) achieve the AWS Migration & Modernization Competency (MMC) and (2) list your SaaS on AWS Marketplace—unlocking MAP rebates, 1.5 % fees, and co‑sell priority.

### ---

 **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS** {#minimum-requirements}

* Join the AWS Partner Network (APN) & pick a Path

  * Create a free Partner Central account, then enrol in the *Services* (migration work) **and** *Software* (SaaS listing) paths. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/services-tiers/))

* **Pay the annual APN fee – US $2,500** (refunded as credits once you hit Advanced). ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/services-tiers/))

* Hit Advanced Tier—this is the entry ticket to any migration badge

  * **People:** 8 accreditations (4 Technical, 4 Business) *plus* 6 AWS Technical Certifications, at least 3 of which are Professional/Specialty. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/services-tiers/))

  * **Activity:** 20 launched ACE-tracked opportunities generating ≥ US $10 k monthly AWS spend. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/services-tiers/))

* Baseline technical proof for migration work

  * Minimum **5 public customer references** covering migrations of ≥ 10 apps each. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/announcing-the-aws-migration-competency/))

  * **10 total AWS certifications** across the firm, with ≥ 2 at Professional level. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/announcing-the-aws-migration-competency/))

  * Pass the **Migration Foundational Technical Review (mFTR)** once your landing-zone IaC and run-books are ready — this is a checklist variant of the standard FTR focused on migration controls. ([apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com](https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/changelog/Validation_Checklist_Change_Log.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

* Marketplace gate-checks (needed *before* a public SaaS listing):

  * **Seller registration completed:** tax/KYC cleared and a payout bank account on file. ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/seller-registration-process.html))

  * **Foundational Technical Review (FTR) approved** for your SaaS workload (valid 3 years). ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/foundational-technical-review/), [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/updates-to-the-aws-foundational-technical-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

  * **SaaS integration:** your service must successfully call the Marketplace **Entitlement** and **Metering** APIs (Contract \+ Usage model is the easiest path). ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-integration-metering-and-entitlement-apis.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-integrate-contract.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

  * Pass the SaaS **product-integration checklist** (automated tests prove you meter usage and honour entitlements). ([docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/aws-marketplace-integration-checklist.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-guidelines.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

* Absolute must-have artefacts on hand

  * APN fee receipt and Advanced-tier scorecard

  * Certification PDFs \+ Badge IDs

  * Five migration case-study PDFs (cost, time, security deltas quantified)

  * Signed FTR/mFTR approval emails

  * Working SaaS metering test logs

**If anything above is missing, AWS will simply block the application form.** Nail these fundamentals first, then circle back to the deeper audit items in your main checklist.

## **Google Cloud Migration Partner & Listing on Google Cloud Marketplace** {#google-cloud-migration-partner-&-listing-on-google-cloud-marketplace}

Google Cloud’s **Cloud Migration Specialization \+ Marketplace listing** has three concentric rings of proof: ① baseline Partner-Build entry, ② the Migration Specialization audit, and ③ Marketplace “enterprise-ready” gating. Below is a drop-in checklist—mirroring your AWS template—that spells out *exact* milestones, artifacts, and the only dates Google actually enforces.

---

### **Purpose** {#purpose-1}

A one-page, at-a-glance guide you can paste into a GTM doc. It shows how to (1) earn the **Cloud Migration Specialization** badge and (2) publish a transactable SaaS or professional-services offer on **Google Cloud Marketplace**, unlocking co-sell priority, startup credits, and the new 1.5 %–3 % revenue-share tiers. ([cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/partners?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [crn.com](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/google-cloud-revamps-marketplace-to-boost-partner-profitability?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Meet these bullets and Google will badge you as a **Cloud Migration Specialization partner** *and* surface PDD Cloud as a low-fee, co-sell-eligible offering on Google Cloud Marketplace.

## **Microsoft Cloud Migration Partner & Listing on Azure Marketplace** {#microsoft-cloud-migration-partner-&-listing-on-azure-marketplace}

### **Purpose** {#purpose-2}

Drop-in GTM doc that shows how to (1) earn the **Infra & Database Migration to Microsoft Azure** specialization and (2) publish a transactable SaaS on Azure Marketplace—unlocking co-sell priority, AMM funding, startup credits, and the 3 %\* marketplace fee (\*1.5 % on renewals via private offers after Oct 1 2024\) ([azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/drive-growth-with-the-most-partnerfocused-business-platform/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [learn.microsoft.com](http://learn.microsoft.com)).

Below is a **one-page, copy-paste-ready checklist** in the same format you used for Google Cloud. It covers the three concentric proofs Microsoft enforces—① **Partner-program baseline**, ② **Migration Specialization audit**, and ③ **Azure Marketplace “enterprise-ready” gating**—so you can land the migration badge, unlock Azure Migrate & Modernize incentives, and ship **PDD Cloud** as a 3 %-fee SaaS offer.

---

### BARE MINIMUM {#bare-minimum}

| \# | What you must ship | Why it matters |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | **Sign into Partner Center → verify company domain → digitally accept the Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA)** ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/microsoft-partner-agreement?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Creates your legal entity in Microsoft’s ecosystem; nothing else (badges, incentives, Marketplace) activates until the MPA is on file. |
| 2 | **Earn the “Solutions Partner – Infrastructure (Azure)” badge** • Score **≥ 70 PCS points** with ≥ 1 point in *Performance, Skilling, Customer Success* ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/membership/partner-capability-score?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/membership/solutions-partner-azure?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) • Upload **4 × AZ-104** (Azure Administrator) and **2 × AZ-305** (Azure Solutions Architect) cert IDs to Partner Center ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-305/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | This badge is the pre-requisite Microsoft lists first for the Migration specialization. Without the 70-point scorecard the specialization tile stays locked in Partner Center. |
| 3 | **Prove real migrations: 3 customers, three-month revenue window** • Either **$30 k Windows-VM ACR** *or* **$15 k Linux-VM ACR** **per customer** **AND** • **$9 k SQL MI/DB ACR** across the same period (min $3 k from MI/SQL DB) ([partner.microsoft.com](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership/specialization/infra-and-database-migration)) • Tag each subscription with **PAL or DPOR** so the ACR flows to your PartnerID ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/membership/link-partner-id-for-azure-performance-pal-dpor?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | Supplies the *Performance* evidence Microsoft checks automatically; no revenue → no specialization audit. |
| 4 | **Pass the third-party Migration specialization audit** (remote, evidence-based) ([partner.microsoft.com](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership/specialization/infra-and-database-migration)) | Independent assessor validates your runbooks, case studies, and security posture; Microsoft will not issue the badge without an Audit-Pass letter. |
| 5 | **Register as an Azure Marketplace seller & clear technical gating** • Create payout \+ tax profile, pass KYC ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/account-settings/set-up-your-payout-account)) • Implement **SaaS Fulfillment API v2** webhooks and retry logic ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/pc-saas-fulfillment-operations-api)) • Meet the baseline listing criteria (logos, pricing, legal URLs, support contact, etc.) and clear Marketplace certification ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/marketplace-criteria-content-validation)) | Without these steps your SaaS stays in *Draft* and cannot transact (or claim the 3 % / 1.5 % private-offer fee). |

---

### 10-Step {#10-step}

1. **0** – Join OPN ($500) → receive membership ID.

2. **1** – Enroll in **Cloud Service** **and** **Cloud Build** tracks ($3 000 each, optionally offset with UCC).

3. **1–2** – Spin up OCI Free Tier tenancy; migrate a demo Firestore-to-OCI deployment of PDD Cloud.

4. **2–4** – Staff earn:

   * OCI 2025 Architect Associate,

   * OCI 2025 Migration Architect Professional,

   * Oracle Cloud Support Specialist,

   * PMP/CSM or Oracle PM Assessment.  
      (Pearson Vue exams are on-demand.)

5. **3–5** – Execute two pilot migrations (e.g., customer sandbox → OCI); collect go-live surveys.

6. **4–5** – Submit **OCI Migration Expertise** packet via PartnerHelp; Oracle SLA is 10 business days.

7. **5–6** – Request **Marketplace Publisher Account**; concurrently draft listing (image or stack).

8. **6–7** – Run Oracle’s automated security scans; attach run-books & DR instructions.

9. **7–8** – Submit listing for review; iterate on comments (use the Partner Portal “Listing Status” tab).

10. **8–10** – Listing goes live → claim **Migration Expertise badge**, activate co-sell in Oracle Partner Portal, and announce via joint press release.

---

### Pro Tips {#pro-tips}

* **Cloud Lift Services** – Free Oracle engineering help to move workloads; enroll once you have an active tenancy (no program sign-up needed).

* **Use the track fee as credits** – Applying the $3 000 Cloud Service fee to UCC effectively zeroes out the first proof-of-concept migration.

* **Leverage 3 % fee** – Oracle dropped Marketplace take-rate from 20 % → 3 % (you keep 97 %) ([blogs.oracle.com](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/oracle-cloud-marketplace-drops-publishing-fees-from-20-to-3-for-all-paid-publisher-listing-transactions?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

* **Fast-path audits** – Oracle accepts pooled resources within a regional market—handy if you have multiple entities ([oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/partnernetwork/expertise/service/oci-migration/)).

* **BYOL first, Paid second** – Ship a BYOL image to shorten listing review to \~5 days, then clone it to a paid/OCPU-metered listing once validation is green.

---

### **Next Action for PDD** {#next-action-for-pdd}

1. Book Pearson Vue slots for the two OCI exams and Support Specialist micro-badge.

2. Stand up an Always-Free OCI region, replicate your Firebase sample data to Autonomous Database, and document the playbook—this becomes both your customer-success artifact **and** the Marketplace deployment guide.

3. Kick off the OPN Member application today; the rest gates on that membership number.

With this sequence, you’ll have PDD Cloud wearing an **“OCI Migration Service Expertise”** ribbon **and** purchasable in Oracle Cloud Marketplace—ready to capture migrations that seek lower egress, Arm/GPU price breaks, and a 3 % marketplace fee.
