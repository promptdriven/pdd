## Bugs Found

### Bug 1: Drawing-only annotation silently fails (FIXED)
- **File:** `app/api/annotations/route.ts`
- **Root cause:** Validation required non-empty `text` field; drawings with no voice/text returned 400 silently.
- **Fix:** Changed validation to allow empty `text` when `drawingDataUrl` is present.
- **Test:** `tests/integration/api_project_script_annotations.test.ts` — "POST with empty text but drawingDataUrl creates annotation (drawing-only)"

### Bug 2: FixPreviewPanel crashes when `filesModified` is undefined (FIXED)
- **File:** `components/FixPreviewPanel.tsx:138`
- **Root cause:** `p.filesModified.length` crashes when API response omits `filesModified` field.
- **Fix:** Changed to `p.filesModified?.length` and `p.filesModified?.join(...)`. Marked interface field as optional.
- **Test:** `tests/test_fix_preview_panel.tsx` — "filesModified null-safety" suite (3 tests)

### Bug 3: FixPreviewPanel shows "NaN% confidence" (FIXED)
- **File:** `components/FixPreviewPanel.tsx`
- **Root cause:** `Math.round(p.confidence * 100)` produces NaN when `confidence` is undefined.
- **Fix:** Changed to `Math.round((p.confidence ?? 0) * 100)`.
- **Test:** `tests/test_fix_preview_panel.tsx` — "confidence NaN-safety" suite (2 tests)

## N/A Items (environment constraints)

These items require conditions not available in the dev environment:
