"context/core/cli_example.py","This Python script serves as a comprehensive demonstration and documentation for the PDD (Prompt Driven Development) Command Line Interface (CLI) module. It illustrates how to programmatically interact with the main entry point (`cli`) and the custom Click Group class (`PDDCLI`) provided by the `pdd.core.cli` package.

The script defines various functions to showcase specific global options and features. Key demonstrations include invoking the CLI with AI configuration parameters like `--strength` (model power), `--temperature` (creativity), and `--time` (reasoning allocation). It also covers operational flags such as `--force` for overwriting files, `--local` for local execution, and `--quiet` for suppressing verbose output.

Furthermore, the file explains advanced features like cost tracking via `--output-cost`, which exports usage data to CSV, and context management using `--list-contexts` and `--context` to handle `.pddrc` configurations. Debugging capabilities are highlighted through the `--core-dump` flag, which captures execution state for error reporting. The `PDDCLI` class is described as a custom extension that enhances help formatting—specifically grouping Generate Suite commands—and centralizes error handling. The `main` function executes these examples sequentially to verify CLI behavior.",2025-12-20T06:54:17.339938+00:00
"context/core/cloud_example.py","This Python script serves as a demonstration and usage guide for the `pdd.core.cloud` module, which handles centralized cloud configuration and authentication for the PDD CLI. The script illustrates three primary functionalities through distinct example functions. First, `example_cloud_urls` demonstrates how to retrieve base URLs and specific endpoint paths, showing how the configuration can be dynamically overridden via environment variables (useful for local testing against emulators). Second, `example_cloud_availability` checks whether cloud features are enabled based on the presence of required API keys (Firebase and GitHub credentials). Finally, `example_authentication_flow` explains the authentication logic, specifically highlighting how the system prioritizes injected JWT tokens (via environment variables) for CI/CD scenarios before falling back to an interactive device flow for user authentication. The script sets up the necessary system paths to import the project module, utilizes the `rich` library for formatted console output, and includes a main execution block to run all examples sequentially.",2025-12-31T01:19:04.386376+00:00
"context/core/dump_example.py","This Python script provides a comprehensive demonstration of the `pdd.core.dump` module, which is designed to facilitate debugging and error reporting for the PDD CLI tool. The script defines several example functions that illustrate the module's core capabilities. Specifically, `example_write_core_dump` shows how to serialize execution context, command results, and cost metrics into a JSON core dump file. The `example_github_config` function validates the environment configuration required for GitHub integration. Furthermore, `example_write_replay_script` demonstrates the automatic generation of shell scripts that allow developers to reproduce specific CLI runs using data from core dumps. The script also includes `example_build_issue_markdown`, which constructs formatted GitHub issue bodies containing platform details, error tracebacks, and reproduction instructions, and `example_post_issue_to_github`, which outlines the API for submitting these issues. A main execution block runs these examples in sequence, creating sample outputs in a local directory to verify the functionality of the core dump and replay logic.",2025-12-20T06:54:32.860639+00:00
"context/core/errors_example.py","This Python script serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the pdd.core.errors module, designed for centralized error handling within the PDD CLI. It illustrates how to utilize the module's key components: a styled Rich console, the handle_error function, and error buffer management tools. The script initializes by ensuring a local output directory exists. It then executes a series of examples showing how to print styled messages (using themes like info, warning, and success) and handle various exception types such as FileNotFoundError, ValueError, and RuntimeError. It specifically highlights the handle_error function's ability to process exceptions gracefully without crashing the application, while offering a quiet mode to record errors silently without console output. Furthermore, the code demonstrates the core dump functionality by retrieving collected errors via get_core_dump_errors(), inspecting their details (command name, exception type, message, and traceback), and exporting them to a JSON file named core_dump_errors.json. It concludes by showing how to clear the error buffer using clear_core_dump_errors(), ensuring the system can reset its error state.",2025-12-20T06:54:47.056324+00:00
"context/core/utils_example.py","The file `utils_example.py` serves as a demonstration and documentation script for the `pdd.core.utils` module, which contains helper functions for the PDD CLI. It defines a series of example functions that illustrate the behavior of core utilities used for environment detection and configuration management. Key functions demonstrated include `_first_pending_command`, which parses Click context arguments to identify subcommands; `_api_env_exists`, which verifies the presence of the global API configuration file; and `_completion_installed`, which checks shell configuration files for tab completion markers. The script also showcases `_project_has_local_configuration` for detecting local `.env` or `.pdd` settings, and `_should_show_onboarding_reminder`, which encapsulates the logic for displaying setup prompts to new users. Additionally, it provides informational usage for `_run_setup_utility`, the function responsible for launching the interactive setup wizard. The script utilizes `unittest.mock.MagicMock` to simulate CLI contexts and includes a `main` function that executes all examples, printing diagnostic output to the console to validate the utility logic.",2025-12-20T06:55:07.181921+00:00
