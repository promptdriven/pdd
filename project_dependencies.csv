context/commands/generate_example.py,"This Python script serves as a comprehensive usage example and documentation for the `pdd.commands.generate` module within the PDD CLI tool. It demonstrates how to programmatically invoke and utilize three primary Click commands: `generate`, `example`, and `test`. The script defines helper functions to set up an output directory and create sample prompt and code files (specifically a simple calculator module) to simulate a real workflow.

The `main` function orchestrates five specific examples: utilizing the `generate` command to create code from prompts with various options like incremental generation and environment variables; using the `example` command to produce usage examples for generated code; employing the `test` command to generate or enhance unit tests, including coverage-based improvements; invoking commands programmatically via Click context management; and using templates with variable substitution. Additionally, the file highlights that all these commands are decorated with `@track_cost` to monitor LLM API usage expenses. The script is designed to be executable, printing detailed explanations of command signatures, arguments, and expected context objects to the console.",8edf3edbed63b4ee85d1ec2b7638d37498ae85538e5967213aaa66fcb3cf5385
context/commands/connect_example.py,"This Python script serves as a usage example and test suite for the `pdd connect` command module within a Click-based CLI application. It demonstrates four key scenarios: integrating the command into a main CLI group, simulating server startup using mocked dependencies (such as `uvicorn` and `webbrowser`) to verify argument parsing without blocking execution, testing security warnings when binding to remote interfaces without authentication tokens, and overriding the default browser target with a custom frontend URL. The script utilizes `unittest.mock` to isolate the command logic from external side effects and `click.testing.CliRunner` to programmatically invoke and verify the command's behavior and output.",d2bcda4ae1e9de22d1b657c28045a0b122dc1ef22a77e4d670f41229779a6083
context/commands/analysis_example.py,"This Python script serves as a demonstration of how to programmatically invoke analysis commands from the `pdd` library, specifically `detect_change`, `conflicts`, `bug`, `crash`, and `trace`. Rather than using the command-line interface, the script manually constructs a `click.Context` to inject necessary global configuration settings—such as verbosity, model strength, and cost tracking—required by the underlying Click-based commands.

The script iterates through five distinct scenarios, generating temporary dummy files (prompts, code snippets, and error logs) in a local ""output"" directory to simulate inputs. These scenarios include: detecting if prompts need updates based on a change request, identifying contradictions between two files, generating a unit test to reproduce a logic bug, analyzing and fixing a crash caused by division by zero, and tracing code execution back to prompt instructions. A helper function, `clean_output`, is used throughout to manage file cleanup and prevent overwrite errors.",3aee1362fca897c88ba026f47eb45cac6d9bc5b0ed57ebfa66b32d5935f606ea
context/commands/fix_example.py,"This Python script serves as a comprehensive demonstration and documentation for the `pdd fix` command within the `pdd` package. The script illustrates how to automatically repair errors in code and unit tests using AI-driven analysis of error logs and original prompts. It begins by setting up a simulated environment, creating sample files including a calculator module with an intentional bug (missing division-by-zero handling), a corresponding unit test, and an error log.

The script defines several functions representing different usage patterns: a basic fix invocation, an iterative ""loop mode"" that verifies fixes against a specific program, an advanced mode with agentic fallback (using Claude, Gemini, or Codex) for complex errors, and options for auto-submitting successful fixes to the PDD Cloud. Additionally, it demonstrates how to track API costs via CSV output and how to invoke the command programmatically within Python code. The `main` function orchestrates the setup but leaves the actual execution of examples commented out to prevent accidental API costs, serving primarily as a reference for developers integrating the `pdd` tool.",a61a1bb14b1f146fab52d7d408d8f2c028c8dc7dea5fc7deaa03205760f826cd
context/commands/utility_example.py,"This Python script serves as a demonstration and documentation tool for the utility commands within the `pdd` package, specifically focusing on the `install_completion_cmd` and `verify` Click commands. It illustrates how to programmatically interact with these tools without executing them fully, thereby avoiding changes to the user's shell configuration or incurring API costs. The script sets up a local environment by creating a directory of dummy files—including a prompt, a buggy Python module (`calculator.py`), and a verification script—to simulate a real-world workflow for the `verify` command. It then prints detailed information to the console using the `rich` library, explaining the inputs, outputs, and command-line arguments for both utilities. The `install_completion_cmd` section explains how shell completion is installed, while the `verify` section details the iterative code fixing process using LLMs, including parameters like budget and max attempts. Additionally, the script documents the specific return value structure of the `verify` command, describing the tuple format containing results, costs, and model names. This file acts as both an executable example and a reference guide for developers integrating or using `pdd` utility commands.",fb7389c0ec837b8b6ee481e2eda04800f565fe247643f5bb9922dd1dfdab984a
context/commands/modify_example.py,"This Python script serves as a comprehensive demonstration and test harness for the `modify` module of the `pdd` CLI tool. It illustrates how to use three primary commands: `split`, `change`, and `update`, which are designed to manage and refactor prompt files and their associated code. The script includes helper functions to set up a local directory structure (`./output/`) and generate necessary sample files, such as large prompts for splitting, code files for updating, and CSVs for batch processing. It then uses `click.testing.CliRunner` to programmatically execute these CLI commands, simulating real-world usage scenarios like splitting a data pipeline prompt, adding logging via change instructions, and updating a prompt based on modified code. The script also highlights the use of the `@track_cost` decorator for monitoring LLM usage costs associated with these operations.",fc27573c54b630f4a61a0a04f3f4ade8feb5c322e77101ec9c73a5aeb962407a

It sets up the execution environment by adding the project root to `sys.path` to ensure internal modules can be imported correctly. The script attempts to import `auth_group` from `pdd.commands.auth` and registers it under a main Click group named `cli`. 

Instead of executing a specific command logic directly, the script is designed to demonstrate the structure and availability of authentication commands. When run as the main program, it prints an introductory message and simulates running `pdd auth --help` to display the help output for the registered authentication commands. It concludes by printing several usage examples to the console, showing users how to perform actions such as interactive login, headless login for CI environments, checking authentication status, retrieving tokens, and logging out. The primary purpose is to verify that the authentication subcommands are correctly wired into the main CLI structure.",d1e77e2ab5a5b6f3c400a8a68a73bb633f6d45e39dd4a90306dcc18c729d9000
context/commands/maintenance_example.py,"This Python script serves as a comprehensive example demonstrating the usage of maintenance commands within the `pdd` package's CLI framework. It showcases three primary Click commands: `sync` (for synchronizing prompts with code and tests), `auto-deps` (for analyzing and injecting dependencies into prompt files), and `setup` (for running an interactive setup utility). The script includes helper functions to create a mock project environment with sample prompt and code files. It then defines separate functions (`example_sync_command`, `example_auto_deps_command`, `example_setup_command`) that utilize `unittest.mock` to simulate the execution of these commands without making actual LLM calls or system modifications. Additionally, it includes an example of how to invoke these commands programmatically, bypassing the CLI parsing while maintaining the Click context.",f347251582821c4347664f674fdd6d5549bb14ba1d0e8bc428cffb9abedbfed3

The `main` function orchestrates these examples, providing context on the purpose of the templates command group, which is designed to facilitate the discovery, inspection, and reuse of prompt templates within the PDD framework.",017d7a9cbdec60dd67cee662f3b21a68638137cd086fb335ef92889e1d91b09a
context/commands/misc_example.py,"This Python script serves as a comprehensive example and test suite for the `pdd.commands.misc.preprocess` module, specifically demonstrating the functionality of the `preprocess` Click command. The script illustrates how to prepare prompt files for Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling directives such as file includes, comments, shell commands, and web scraping locally without API calls. It defines a setup function to generate sample prompt and text files, followed by five distinct example functions that simulate command-line execution using `CliRunner`. These examples cover basic preprocessing, XML delimiter insertion, curly bracket doubling (with exclusion logic for template variables), recursive file inclusion, and a combination of these options. The script concludes with a main execution block that runs all examples sequentially, printing the results and exit codes to the console, thereby verifying the preprocessor's capabilities in handling various formatting and content integration tasks.",7d7985d21dd7b962257856cb92d13e26c016bc09ce14aaac4c68baaead97dc4b
context/commands/__init___example.py,"This Python script serves as a demonstration and usage example for the `register_commands` module within a project named PDD (Python Development Driver). The file illustrates how to set up a Click-based Command Line Interface (CLI) by importing and utilizing the `register_commands` function to attach various subcommands to a main `click.Group`. It defines a primary CLI entry point (`cli`) and a secondary custom example (`custom_cli`), showing that the registration process works on any Click group. The script documents the specific categories of commands available, including Generation, Fixing, Modification, Maintenance, Analysis, Miscellaneous, Utility, and Templates. When executed directly, the script prints a formatted list of these registered commands organized by category, displaying their help text summaries, and provides usage examples for invoking the CLI tools.

context/commands/sessions_example.py,"This file contains a Python test/demonstration script designed to verify the functionality of a CLI module, specifically the `pdd.commands.sessions` component. The script primarily focuses on mocking external dependencies to allow standalone execution without a real backend connection. It mocks several modules within the `pdd` namespace, including `core.cloud`, `remote_session`, and `utils`, replacing them with `unittest.mock.MagicMock` objects. Key mocked components include `CloudConfig` for handling JWT tokens and `RemoteSessionManager` for retrieving session data. The script defines a `DummySession` class and populates a fake dataset containing sample session information (IDs, project names, URLs, statuses). It implements asynchronous mock functions (`mock_list_sessions` and `mock_get_session`) to simulate API responses. The `run_example` function utilizes `click.testing.CliRunner` to programmatically invoke CLI commands (`list` and `info`) and print the results to the console using the `rich` library. This setup allows developers to visualize the output of commands like `sessions list` (in both table and JSON formats) and `sessions info <id>`, as well as handle error cases like missing sessions, ensuring the CLI interface behaves correctly under controlled conditions.",b4d9f8c45f3bf02f9e531bd411937872dfc77705a225a03f56df86c197da13bf
context/commands/output/change_request.txt,"The provided file content is extremely brief, consisting of a single directive: ""Update all functions to include type hints."" This instruction serves as a coding standard or refactoring task, likely intended for a software development context using a statically typed language or a dynamically typed language that supports optional typing, such as Python (with type hints introduced in PEP 484) or TypeScript. The goal of this directive is to improve code readability, maintainability, and error checking by explicitly declaring the expected data types for function arguments and return values. By implementing type hints, developers can leverage static analysis tools and IDE features to catch type-related bugs early in the development process, rather than at runtime. This task implies a review of an existing codebase where functions currently lack these annotations, requiring a systematic update to modernize the code and align it with best practices for type safety.",61b4a2bac1dc072dc710a4f5dec21e2ab76a153b70bd72e5e5dea884fd77965f
context/commands/output/theme_light.txt,"The provided file content is extremely brief, consisting of a single directive: ""Use light theme default."" This statement appears to be a configuration setting or a user preference instruction, likely intended for a software application, website, or operating system interface. It explicitly specifies that the visual theme should be set to ""light"" mode by default, rather than a dark mode or a system-adaptive setting. In the context of UI/UX design or software development, this line would typically be found in a settings file (such as a JSON, YAML, or INI configuration), a CSS variable definition, or a documentation snippet guiding users or developers on how to establish the initial visual appearance of the interface. The instruction implies a binary choice between light and dark themes, prioritizing the former as the standard starting point for the user experience.",9b33e7cdd8868f0132464fbb58887101dd2ff07cfe5fa62ba59cfa30e3ac5bc9
context/commands/output/detect_results.csv,"The provided file contains a set of instructions for updating specific prompt files, formatted as a CSV dataset with columns for the prompt name and the corresponding change instructions. The file lists two entries: 'math_ops.prompt' and 'string_ops.prompt'. Both entries share a nearly identical set of modification requests aimed at standardizing the output of an LLM. Specifically, the instructions require updating the persona to that of an 'expert Python engineer' and inserting a new section titled 'Code Style Requirements' before the function description. Within this new section, a specific rule must be added mandating that all functions be fully type-hinted, covering both parameters and return types. Furthermore, the goal statements in both prompts need to be modified to explicitly request a 'fully type-hinted Python function.' While the core logic of the prompts differs—one focuses on adding numbers and the other on concatenating strings—the primary objective of these changes is to enforce strict Python type-hinting standards across the generated code.",5f25d97cc5a6a09ee4f99655b102db3080a27b64cbcbe76c7cb3621eb75f4e47

context/commands/output/conflicts.csv,"The provided file contents outline specific change instructions for two prompt configuration files related to UI theming: 'theme_dark.txt' and 'theme_light.txt'. The instructions aim to resolve conflicts between static default settings for Dark and Light themes by introducing dynamic or conditional logic. For the Dark Theme prompt, the recommendation is to move away from a static default and instead implement logic based on the user's system preference, specific time ranges (18:00 to 06:00), or environmental context (low-light). Similarly, the Light Theme prompt instructions suggest resolving conflicts by deferring to system preferences (or lack thereof), using time-based logic (06:01 to 17:59), or establishing the light theme as a standard baseline. Both sets of instructions focus on creating a more adaptive and conflict-free user experience by removing rigid defaults.",43500019d4c7e73e7e3f3a6ea3ac790dc561de52537a6dd8050e451892b3a8be
context/commands/output/run_calc.py,"The provided file content is a very brief Python script that demonstrates the usage of a specific function imported from an external module. The script begins by importing a function named 'mul' from a module named 'calc'. This suggests the existence of a separate file or package named 'calc' which likely contains mathematical operations, specifically multiplication in this context. Following the import statement, the script executes a print function call. Inside this print statement, the imported 'mul' function is invoked with two integer arguments, 2 and 3.
