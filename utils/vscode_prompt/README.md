# Prompt Driven Development (PDD) Extension

[![▶ Watch the overview video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/5lBxpTSnjqo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lBxpTSnjqo)

Build software with prompts as the durable source of truth. This extension provides first‑class editing for `.prompt` files—clear syntax highlighting and editor behaviors—so requirements stay human‑readable while code becomes a regenerable artifact.

Why this matters: AI agents can draft code in seconds, but teams often spend hours repairing breakage and drift. Instead of treating prompts as one‑off instructions, PDD formalizes the prompt as the canonical spec. You iterate on the prompt; the system regenerates code deterministically and safely.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for `.prompt` files
- Language configuration for predictable editing (comments, brackets)
- Works alongside `pdd` CLI to turn prompts into code

## Why PDD vs. Spec-Driven and Vibe Coding

- Spec-driven aims for spec → code. PDD inserts an explicit engineering layer: spec → prompts → code. Developers refine the partitioning into a suite of precise, version-controlled prompts (easier to tune than partitioning code), then regenerate artifacts deterministically.
- Vibe coding is ad‑hoc prompting and auto‑accepting of code patches. It is like throwing a grenade in the codebase: you never know what will be changed, deleted or duplicated. In contrast, PDD couples every prompt with automated validation; generated code is accepted only if tests pass. No surprise changes—reviewable diffs and test‑gated merges.
- PDD is built for real projects: modular prompts, few‑shot context reuse, and regeneration that reduces drift. The whitepaper documents measurable benefits and benchmarks on non‑toy codebases.


| Approach     | Source of truth        | Change process                          | Acceptance gate               |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Vibe coding  | Traditional code files | Prompts that auto-patch code files      | Human eyeballing              |
| Spec‑driven | Static spec document   | Spec → code (direct synthesis/patches) | Reviews; fragile regeneration |
| PDD          | Versioned prompt suite | Spec → prompts → code (regenerate)    | Automated tests + review      |

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.96+ or any OpenVSX-compatible IDE
- Compatible with VS Code, Cursor, VSCodium, Gitpod, Kiro, Windsurf, and other OpenVSX-compatible editors

## Installation

### VS Code Marketplace
Install directly from the VS Code marketplace in VS Code or compatible editors.

### OpenVSX Marketplace
For OpenVSX-compatible IDEs (VSCodium, Gitpod, Kiro, Windsurf, etc.), install from the OpenVSX marketplace:
- VSCodium: Search for "Prompt Driven Development" in the Extensions view
- Gitpod: Available through the OpenVSX marketplace integration
- Kiro: Available through the OpenVSX marketplace integration
- Windsurf: Available through the OpenVSX marketplace integration
- Other OpenVSX-compatible editors: Use the OpenVSX marketplace URL

## PDD CLI Installation

- Getting started with PDD CLI (Gemini setup): https://github.com/promptdriven/pdd/blob/main/SETUP_WITH_GEMINI.md

## Get Started

- Create a `.prompt` file that expresses intent and constraints.
- Use this extension to edit and validate the prompt with good ergonomics.
- Use `pdd` tooling to synthesize code from the prompt and keep artifacts in sync.

Extension contributes:

- Custom language support for `.prompt`
- File association and syntax highlighting

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release with syntax highlighting for `.prompt` files.
