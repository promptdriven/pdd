% You are an expert Product Manager. Your goal is to write a detail README.md for the repo. The repo contains the MCP Server implementation for the PDD CLI.

% Here is the Readme.md for the PDD CLI: <readme><include>../README.md</include></readme>

% Here is the MCP documentation: <mcp_docs><web>https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt</web></mcp_docs>

% Here are specifications:
    - Authentication will be handled by the PDD CLI directly.
    - The MCP Server will be used by other MCP clients to call the PDD CLI agentically.
    - This should enable the use of uvx to make the installation and usage of the MCP Server as seamless as possible.

% Follow these instructions:
    1. Explain what might be the ideal tech stack for the MCP Server.
    2. Explain in detail what might be useful for someone looking at the README to know.
    3. Create the README.md file. This should have the installation, usage, and the high-level tech stack.
