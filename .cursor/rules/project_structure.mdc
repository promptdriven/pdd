- Main CLI commands should be defined in pdd/cli.py
- Implementation of each command should be in separate *_main.py files
- Prompt files should be stored in the prompts/ directory
- Test files should mirror the structure of the implementation files
- Shared utilities should be placed in appropriate modules for reuse
- Follow the established pattern for new features: implementation → test → CLI integration
