- Use Click for all CLI commands
- Follow consistent command structure pattern from existing commands:
  - Command name should be descriptive and use snake_case
  - All commands should use @track_cost decorator
  - Add appropriate type hints including return types
  - All commands should have help text
  - Use @click.pass_context for context passing
- When adding a new command:
  - Update the completion scripts (pdd_completion.zsh, pdd_completion.sh, pdd_completion.fish)
  - Add appropriate tests in tests/test_<command_name>.py
  - Document the command in README.md
