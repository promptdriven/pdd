- Pin dependency versions to ensure reproducibility
- Keep requirements.txt and pyproject.toml dependencies in sync
- Document dependency changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Group dependencies logically (core, dev, optional)
- For new dependencies:
  - Add to both pyproject.toml and requirements.txt
  - Update development environment instructions
  - Consider compatibility with supported Python versions (3.11+)
- Limit transitive dependencies where possible
