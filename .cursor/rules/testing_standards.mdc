- Use pytest for all tests
- Mock external API calls and LLM responses in tests
- Structure test files to mirror the module structure (test_x.py for x.py)
- Use pytest fixtures for common test setup
- Test both success paths and error/edge cases
- Include appropriate assertions with descriptive messages
- When testing LLM functionality, use MockLLM pattern from test_llm_invoke.py
- For CLI tests, use Click's testing utilities
