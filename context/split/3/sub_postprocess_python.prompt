% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a Python function called 'find_section' that will find top-level code sections in a string output from an LLM.

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Inputs:
        'lines' - A list of strings, where each string is a line from the LLM output.
        'start_index' - An integer representing the starting index to begin searching (default is 0).
        'sub_section' - A boolean flag indicating whether this is a recursive call for a sub-section (default is False).
    Output: returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (code_language, start_line, end_line) for each top-level code section found.

% Here is an example of how the function might be called:
```python
lines = llm_output.splitlines()
sections = find_section(lines)
```

% Here is an example of llm_output: '''To implement the `context_generator` function as described, we will follow the steps outlined in your request. Below is the complete implementation of the function, which includes reading a Python file, preprocessing it, generating a prompt for the model, invoking the model, and writing the output to a specified file.

```python
import os

def context_generator(python_filename: str, output_filename: str, force: bool = False) -> bool:
    # Step 1: Read the Python file
    try:
        with open(python_filename, 'r') as file:
            python_code = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file {python_filename} does not exist.")
        return False


    # Step 3: Generate a prompt for GPT-4
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert Python engineer. Based on the following Python code, generate a concise example of how to use the module properly.

    Python Code:
    ```python
    {processed_content}
    ```

    return True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **File Reading**: The function attempts to read the specified Python file. If the file does not exist, it prints an error message and returns `False`.
2. **Preprocessing**: It calls the `preprocess` function to process the content of the Python file.

### Usage:
You can call this function by providing the necessary arguments, like so:

```python
context_generator('your_python_file.py', 'output_example.py', force=False)
```

Make sure to replace `'your_python_file.py'` and `'output_example.py'` with the actual file names you want to use.
To implement the context_generator function as described, we will follow the steps outlined in   
your request. Below is the complete implementation of the function, which includes reading a     
Python file, preprocessing it, generating a prompt for the model, invoking the model, and writing
the output to a specified file.'''

% This function will do the following:
    Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the sections found.
    Step 2. Iterate through the lines starting from start_index:
        Step 2a. Find the start of a code block (line starting with triple backticks).
        Step 2b. If another start of a code block is found, call 'find_section' recursively with sub_section flag set to True.
        Step 2c. If the end of a code block is found (line with just triple backticks), do one of the following steps depending on the sub_section flag:
            Step 2c_i: If it is a sub-section, return an empty list.
            Step 2c_ii: If it is not a sub-section, record the program type and start/end lines into the output list.
    Step 3. Return the list of sections found.
