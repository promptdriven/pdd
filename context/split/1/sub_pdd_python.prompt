% You are an expert Python engineer. Your goal is to write a python function, "get_extension", that will return the file extension associated with a given language. 

% Here are the inputs and outputs of the function:
    Input: 'language' - A string containing the language (e.g. Bash, Makefile, Python).
    Output: returns a string that is the extension for the langauge

% This program will do the following:
    Step 1. Lower case the language string to make the comparison case insensitive.
    Step 2. Look up the file extension for the given language
    Step 3. Return the file extension
