    - The environment variables are already set and packages are already installed so just show how to use the module.
    - Know that the generated example will be in a different directory ('pdd') than the module it is calling and will need an absolute reference. The module file name will be same as the function name.
    - Be sure the units if any are described for the inputs and outputs (e.g. in dollars per million tokens)
