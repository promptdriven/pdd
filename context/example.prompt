    - The environment variables are already set and packages are already installed so just show how to use the module.
    - Know that the generated example will be in a different directory ('pdd') than the module it is calling and will need an absolute reference. The module file name will be same as the function name.
    - Be sure the units if any are described for the inputs and outputs (e.g. in dollars per million tokens)
    - When creating Click examples, be sure to pass in arguments so the example can be run without user input.
    - When working with files, create the content of required examples files that would be read by the function.
