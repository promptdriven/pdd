      "The Eiffel Tower stands out for several reasons:  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Architectural & engineering marvel  \n",
      "  – When it was completed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair), its 300 m height made it the tallest man‑made structure on Earth.  \n",
      "  – Its open‑lattice iron framework was revolutionary at the time, demonstrating advances in materials and wind‑resistance design.  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Iconic symbol  \n",
      "  – Over the past 130+ years it has become the emblem of Paris and, more broadly, of France’s spirit of innovation and culture.  \n",
      "  – You’ll find it in countless artworks, films, postcards—its silhouette is instantly recognized worldwide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Spectacular views  \n",
      "  – Three viewing levels (including the 2nd‑floor restaurant and the top deck at 276 m) offer 360° panoramas of Paris’s rooftops, the Seine River, Montmartre and beyond.  \n",
      "  – On a clear day you can see for miles, making it one of the city’s best photo‑op spots.  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Day‑to‑night experience  \n",
      "  – By day its delicate iron tracery plays with light and shadow; after dusk its 20,000+ bulbs sparkle every hour on the hour.  \n",
      "  – You can dine “in” or “under” the Tower in one of its two restaurants, or simply picnic on the nearby Champ de Mars lawn.  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Cultural hub  \n",
      "  – Beyond sightseeing, the Eiffel Tower hosts art installations, pop‑up shops, seasonal exhibitions and even ice‑skating or ice‑sculpture events in winter.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All these elements combine to make it not just a “big metal tower,” but a living monument that captures Paris’s past, present and very romantic atmosphere.\n"
