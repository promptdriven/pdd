pdd_mcp_server/__init__.py,__init__.py,Standard Python Package Marker,"Makes the 'pdd_mcp_server' directory a Python package. Typically empty.",
pdd_mcp_server/main.py,main.py,Application Entry Point,"This script serves as the main entry point for the MCP server when run directly (e.g., `python -m pdd_mcp_server.main` or via `uvx`). 
It initializes the MCP server instance, registers all the defined PDD tools, sets up the stdio transport, connects the server to the transport, and starts the server's main loop to listen 
for and process client requests. It orchestrates the overall server startup and execution.",mcp, asyncio, .server, .tools
pdd_mcp_server/server.py,server.py,MCP Server Core Logic,"Defines the core `McpServer` instance or a subclass. It sets the server's identity (`name`, `version`) and declares its capabilities
to clients during initialization (primarily specifying support for 'tools' and potentially 'logging'). It might contain helper methods for server setup but delegates tool registration and 
handling logic.",mcp.server.Server, mcp.types
pdd_mcp_server/tools/__init__.py,__init__.py,Tools Sub-package Marker,"Makes the 'tools' directory a Python sub-package. It might import key functions or classes from other modules within 
the sub-package for easier access.",
pdd_mcp_server/tools/definitions.py,definitions.py,Tool Schema Definitions,"This module is responsible for defining the structure of each PDD command exposed as an MCP tool. It will contain 
the list of `mcp.types.Tool` objects. Each object defines the tool's `name` (e.g., 'pdd-generate'), `description`, and crucially, the `inputSchema` (as a JSON Schema dictionary). This schema
details the expected arguments and options for the corresponding `pdd` command, including their types, descriptions, and whether they are required. Pydantic models might be defined here to 
auto-generate these schemas.",mcp.types, typing, json, pydantic (optional)
pdd_mcp_server/tools/handlers.py,handlers.py,Tool Call Handlers,"Contains the actual implementation logic for handling `tools/call` requests for each defined PDD tool. Each handler function 
will receive the tool name and parsed arguments (validated against the inputSchema). It will use the `pdd_runner` utility to construct and execute the corresponding `pdd-cli` command via 
`subprocess`. It then processes the subprocess result (stdout, stderr, exit code) and formats it into an `mcp.types.CallToolResult`, indicating success or failure (`isError`).",mcp.types, 
typing, .runner
pdd_mcp_server/tools/runner.py,runner.py,PDD CLI Subprocess Runner,"Provides a utility function or class to abstract the execution of `pdd-cli` commands. This module handles constructing the
command list from arguments, running `subprocess.run` or `subprocess.Popen`, capturing stdout and stderr, checking the exit code, handling timeouts, and returning a structured result (e.g., 
success status, stdout, stderr) to the tool handlers. It ensures consistent and robust execution of the external CLI.",subprocess, typing, shutil
pyproject.toml,pyproject.toml,Project Configuration and Build,"Defines project metadata (name, version, author, license), dependencies (runtime like `mcp`, optional like `pydantic`, 
development like `pytest`), build system configuration (e.g., setuptools or hatch), and crucially, the entry point for `uvx` (e.g., ` pdd-mcp-server = pdd_mcp_server.main:run_server`). This 
file is essential for packaging, installation, and making the server runnable via `uvx`.",

.gitignore,.gitignore,Git Ignore Rules,"Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., virtual environments, cache files, build artifacts). Standard Python .gitignore 
content.",

reporting.",
