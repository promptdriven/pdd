"pyproject.toml","Project configuration and build file using the TOML format. Defines essential project metadata such as the package name ('pdd-mcp-server'), version, author, license (MIT), 
and description. Specifies runtime dependencies required for the server to function (e.g., 'mcp', potentially 'httpx' if runner uses it, though subprocess is more likely) and development 
dependencies (e.g., 'pytest'). Configures the build backend (e.g., 'hatchling', 'setuptools'). Crucially, it defines the script entry point for tools like 'uvx' or console scripts, mapping a
command name (e.g., 'pdd-mcp-server') to the main execution function (likely in 'pdd_mcp_server.main'). Uses standard TOML syntax.","Inputs: Project structure, Metadata (name, version, 
author, license, description), List of runtime dependencies (e.g., 'mcp'), List of development dependencies (e.g., 'pytest'), Entry point definition (e.g., `pdd-mcp-server = 
pdd_mcp_server.main:main_func`)","Outputs: Configuration for build tools (pip, uv, hatch), Definition of installable package, Definition of executable script entry point for uvx/pip 
install.","",3
"pdd_mcp_server/server.py","Simple module providing version information and a factory function to create the MCP server. Uses importlib.metadata to retrieve the package version when available, falling back to a default version if not. This is a thin wrapper that initializes a Server instance with the proper name, version, and description for the PDD MCP Server.","Inputs: None directly, indirectly uses package metadata for version information","Outputs: A function that creates and returns a configured MCP server instance.","mcp.server",4
"pdd_mcp_server/tools/definitions.py","Defines the static structure and schema for all PDD commands exposed as MCP tools. It imports `mcp.types` and potentially `pydantic` for schema 
generation. It iterates through the list of desired PDD commands (generate, test, fix, etc., based on the README) and creates an `mcp.types.Tool` object for each. Each `Tool` object 
contains: `name` (e.g., 'pdd-generate'), `description` (human-readable explanation), and `inputSchema` (a dictionary representing the JSON Schema for the tool's arguments). The `inputSchema`
meticulously defines each parameter corresponding to a `pdd <command>` option/argument (e.g., 'prompt_file', 'output', 'strength', 'loop'), specifying its type ('string', 'number', 
'boolean', 'array'), description, and whether it's required. This file acts as the authoritative source for how clients should interact with the tools.","Inputs: Implicit knowledge of all 
relevant `pdd-cli` commands and their specific arguments, types, defaults, and descriptions (from pdd_readme).","Outputs: A list or dictionary containing configured `mcp.types.Tool` 
instances, one for each exposed PDD command.","mcp.types, typing, pydantic (optional)",5
"pdd_mcp_server/tools/runner.py","Provides a dedicated utility function or class for executing `pdd-cli` commands as subprocesses. This module abstracts the complexities of interacting with 
the external CLI. It likely defines a function like `run_pdd_command(cmd_list: list, timeout: int = 60) -> PddResult`. This function takes a list of strings (the command and its arguments, 
e.g., ['pdd', 'generate', 'in.prompt']), uses `shutil.which('pdd')` to find the executable path, and then executes it using `subprocess.run` (or an async equivalent like 
`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`). It captures stdout and stderr (decoded as UTF-8), waits for completion (with a timeout), and checks the return code. It handles potential errors like 
`FileNotFoundError` (if pdd isn't found) or `TimeoutExpired`. It returns a structured object (e.g., a dataclass `PddResult`) containing the success status (bool, based on return code), 
stdout (str), stderr (str), and exit_code (int). This module should be entirely independent of MCP concepts. Uses `subprocess`, `typing`, `shutil`, potentially `asyncio`.","Inputs: 
`cmd_list` (list): A list containing the 'pdd' command and all its arguments/options. `timeout` (int, optional): Maximum execution time in seconds.","Outputs: A structured result, likely a 
dataclass or named tuple (e.g., `PddResult(success: bool, stdout: str, stderr: str, exit_code: int)`), representing the outcome of the subprocess execution.","subprocess, typing, shutil, 
asyncio (optional)",6
"pdd_mcp_server/tools/handlers.py","Contains the Python functions that handle the logic for each MCP tool invocation (`tools/call` requests). It imports `mcp.types` and the runner function 
from `tools/runner.py`. For each tool defined in `definitions.py`, there's a corresponding async handler function (e.g., `async def handle_pdd_generate(arguments: dict) -> 
mcp.types.CallToolResult:`). This function receives the validated `arguments` dictionary from the MCP client. Its primary job is to translate these arguments into a command-line list 
suitable for `pdd-cli` (e.g., `['pdd', 'generate', '--output', arguments['output'], arguments['prompt_file']]`). It handles boolean flags (e.g., adding '--loop' if `arguments['loop']` is 
true) and optional arguments. It then calls `runner.run_pdd_command` with the constructed list. Based on the `PddResult` returned by the runner (success status, stdout, stderr), it 
constructs and returns an `mcp.types.CallToolResult`. If the runner indicates success, the result contains the relevant output (usually stdout) as `mcp.types.TextContent` and 
`isError=False`. If the runner indicates failure, the result contains the error message (usually stderr) and `isError=True`.","Inputs: `arguments` (dict): A dictionary containing the 
validated arguments for the specific tool being called, matching the `inputSchema` from definitions.py. Passed by the MCP SDK.","Outputs: Returns an `mcp.types.CallToolResult` instance 
containing `content` (list of `TextContent` or potentially `ResourceContent`) and `isError` (bool) indicating the success or failure of the underlying PDD command execution.","mcp.types, 
typing, .runner",7
"pdd_mcp_server/main.py","The main entry point for the MCP server application, particularly when run via `uvx pdd-mcp-server` or `python -m pdd_mcp_server`. This module uses `FastMCP` from the MCP SDK to create and configure the server. It imports the tool definitions from `tools/definitions.py` and the handler functions from `tools/handlers.py`. It creates a function to register tools with FastMCP using its decorator-based API, wrapping the handler functions to receive parameters as keyword arguments. It handles logging configuration and provides error handling. The server runs with stdio transport using the FastMCP's built-in `run_stdio_async()` method, which manages the exchange of JSON-RPC messages over stdin/stdout correctly according to the MCP protocol. Uses `mcp.server.fastmcp`, `asyncio`, `.tools.definitions`, `.tools.handlers`.","Inputs: Stdin stream containing JSON-RPC messages from the MCP client. Environment variables (passed implicitly, potentially used by pdd-cli).","Outputs: Stdout stream sending JSON-RPC messages to the MCP client. Stderr stream for logging (can be configured via MCP logging or direct prints). Process exit code.","asyncio, mcp.server.fastmcp, .tools.definitions, .tools.handlers",8
