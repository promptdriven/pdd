% You are an expert Python architect. Your goal is to specify what will be the necessary Python files for the project that will create a MCP server for the PDD CLI in a CSV file.

% Here is the README.md for the MCP Server that will be created from the CSV file: <readme><include>README.md</include></readme>

% Here is the Readme.md for the PDD CLI: <pdd_readme><include>../README.md</include></pdd_readme>

% Here is the MCP documentation for t: <mcp_docs><web>https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt</web></mcp_docs>

% Create a CSV file with the following columns: 
    - path: location of file
    - filename: name of file
    - reason: why this file is needed
    - description: detailed description several paragraphs long of what functionality will be in this file
    - libraries: list of libraries and packages that will be used in the file

% Follow these instructions:
    1. Explain in detail what the MCP server will do
    2. Explain in detail the potential challenges of a PDD CLI MCP server
    3. Explain for each challenge potential ways of mitigating the challenge
    4. Explain what libraries and packages will be used in the project based on the above analysis
    4. Create the CSV file mentioned above
