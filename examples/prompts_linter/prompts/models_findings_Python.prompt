The `models_findings` module defines the canonical data structures used throughout the PDD Prompt Linter. It acts as the shared contract between the backend linting engine, the CLI, and the API/UI. Its primary responsibility is to provide strictly typed, validatable Pydantic models that represent linting results, including findings, severity levels, evidence locations, and summary statistics.

Requirements
1.  **Severity Enum**: Define a string-based Enum named `Severity` with values `error`, `warn`, and `info`.
2.  **Core Models**: Implement the following Pydantic models to match the PRD's JSON schema:
    *   `Evidence`: Captures line numbers (`line_start`, `line_end`).
    *   `SuggestedEdit`: Captures a proposed fix (`kind`, `snippet`).
    *   `Finding`: Represents a single rule violation (`rule_id`, `severity`, `title`, `message`, `evidence`, `suggested_edits`).
    *   `IssueCounts`: Tracks the count of issues by severity.
    *   `Summary`: Aggregates the score, issue counts, and token estimates.
    *   `LintReport`: The root object containing the filename, summary, and list of findings.
3.  **Validation**: Ensure all fields are strictly typed. `suggested_edits` should default to an empty list if not provided. `evidence` should be optional (nullable) as some errors may be file-level.
4.  **Serialization**: The models must be easily serializable to JSON (standard Pydantic behavior) for CLI and API output.
5.  **Immutability**: Prefer immutable models (frozen=True) where practical to prevent accidental modification of lint results after generation.

Dependencies
% No external dependencies for this leaf module.
% Standard library imports only (typing, enum).
% Third-party: pydantic.

Prompt Dependencies:
% No prompt dependencies.

Instructions
- Use `pydantic` (assume v2 compatibility, using `BaseModel`).
- Define `Severity` as a class inheriting from `str` and `Enum`.
- In `Finding`, ensure `rule_id` is a string (e.g., "PDD001").
- In `Summary`, `score` should be an integer (0-100).
- In `LintReport`, `findings` should be a list of `Finding` objects.
- `IssueCounts` should have integer fields for `error`, `warn`, and `info`, defaulting to 0.
- Ensure the `LintReport` model can represent the exact JSON structure shown in the PRD (Section 3.2).
- Add docstrings to all models explaining their purpose.

Deliverable
- `src/backend/models/findings.py`

Implementation assumptions (explicit)
- The `kind` field in `SuggestedEdit` is a string (e.g., "replace", "insert_after") but does not need a strict Enum for this MVP, a string literal type or just `str` is acceptable.
- Token estimates in `Summary` are integers.
- The module will be used by `lint_engine.py` to construct results and `cli/pddl.py` to display them.
