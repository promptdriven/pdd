The `include_resolver` module is a core utility responsible for safely resolving file paths referenced in `<include>` tags within prompt files, reading their content, and providing simple token estimation. It acts as a security boundary by enforcing root directory constraints to prevent path traversal attacks and manages resource usage by estimating token counts (e.g., character count / 4) to detect potential context dumps. This module is critical for the linter's ability to analyze the full context of a prompt without executing external code or relying on network calls.

Requirements
1.  **Path Resolution:** The module must resolve relative paths found in `<include>` tags against a base directory (usually the directory of the prompt file being linted).
2.  **Security Enforcement:** It must enforce a "security root" (defaulting to the current working directory or a configured path). Any resolved path attempting to traverse outside this root (e.g., via `../`) must raise a security error or be ignored with a warning.
3.  **Content Retrieval:** It must read the content of resolved files. If a file is missing, it should return a placeholder or error indicator rather than crashing, allowing the linter to report the missing file as a finding.
4.  **Token Estimation:** It must provide a function to estimate tokens for a given string. The heuristic is simple: `len(text) / 4`.
5.  **Recursion Handling:** While full recursive resolution is not strictly required for the MVP linter (which focuses on the top-level prompt), the resolver should be designed to handle a single level of inclusion or be extensible for recursion if needed later. For this MVP, resolving the immediate includes is sufficient to estimate total context size.
6.  **Error Handling:** It must handle `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and Unicode decoding errors gracefully, returning structured feedback or safe defaults.
7.  **Performance:** File I/O should be efficient. Token estimation must be a fast, stateless calculation.

Instructions
-   Implement a class `IncludeResolver` that accepts a `root_path` in its constructor.
-   Create a method `resolve(self, file_path: str, base_dir: str) -> str` that:
    -   Combines `base_dir` and `file_path`.
    -   Normalizes the path.
    -   Checks if the path is within `root_path`.
    -   Returns the absolute path if valid, or raises/returns an error if invalid.
-   Create a method `read_content(self, file_path: str) -> str` that safely opens and reads the file.
-   Create a static method `estimate_tokens(text: str) -> int` implementing the `len(text) / 4` heuristic.
-   Define custom exceptions for `PathSecurityError` and `FileLoadError` to allow the caller (Lint Engine) to distinguish between malicious attempts and missing files.
-   Ensure the module uses `pathlib` for robust path manipulation.
-   Do not implement any caching mechanism for this MVP; the OS file system cache is sufficient for the scale of prompt linting.

Deliverable
-   `src/backend/core/include_resolver.py`: The complete implementation of the `IncludeResolver` class and helper functions.

Implementation assumptions (explicit)
-   The "security root" is assumed to be the directory where the CLI is run, unless overridden.
-   Token estimation does not need to match OpenAI/Anthropic tokenizers exactly; a rough heuristic is acceptable for the "Goldilocks" rules.
-   The resolver does not need to parse the file to find includes; it only resolves paths provided to it (the Parser extracts the paths).
