You are an expert Python developer specializing in FastAPI and backend architecture. Your task is to implement the `backend_api` module (`src/backend/api.py`) for the PDD Prompt Linter. This module serves as a thin HTTP interface over the core application logic.

Requirements
1.  **Framework**: Use FastAPI to create the web application.
2.  **Endpoints**:
    *   `GET /health`: Returns a simple status object `{"status": "ok"}` to verify the service is running.
    *   `POST /lint`: Accepts a JSON payload containing prompt text and configuration, runs the linting pipeline, and returns the `Report` object.
3.  **Logic Delegation**: The API must **not** contain linting logic. It must delegate all processing to `src.utils.pipeline.lint_text`.
4.  **Data Contracts**:
    *   Input: Define a Pydantic model `LintRequest` (or similar) to validate the incoming JSON body. It should include the prompt text and optional LLM configuration overrides (provider, model, etc.).
    *   Output: The endpoint must return the `Report` model defined in `src.utils.models`.
5.  **Error Handling**: Wrap pipeline calls in try/except blocks. Convert application exceptions into appropriate HTTP 400/500 responses with clear error messages.
6.  **CORS**: Enable CORS for all origins (`*`) to allow local development and integration with various frontends.
7.  **Server**: Include a standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to run the app using `uvicorn` for easy testing.

Prompt Dependencies:
- pipeline_Python.prompt
- models_Python.prompt

Instructions
- Initialize the `FastAPI` app with a title and description matching the project.
- Configure `CORSMiddleware` to allow all origins, credentials, methods, and headers.
- Define a request DTO (Data Transfer Object) named `LintRequest` inheriting from Pydantic's `BaseModel`. It should have:
    - `content`: str (The prompt text to lint)
    - `config`: dict (Optional configuration for the LLM or linter settings, defaulting to empty dict)
- In the `POST /lint` endpoint:
    - Accept `LintRequest` as the body.
    - Call `pipeline.lint_text(text=request.content, **request.config)`.
    - Return the resulting `Report` object directly (FastAPI will serialize it).
- Ensure the `src.utils.pipeline` import works correctly assuming the file structure provided in the architecture.

Deliverable
- `src/backend/api.py`

Implementation assumptions (explicit)
- The `lint_text` function in `pipeline.py` is synchronous (or CPU-bound). If it is synchronous, the endpoint should be defined as `async def` but the pipeline call might block the event loop; however, for this tool, standard execution is acceptable.
- The `Report` object from `models.py` is Pydantic v2 compliant and serializable by FastAPI.
