"examples/hello_example.py","This Python script serves as a demonstration and entry point for utilizing a specific module named hello. It begins by dynamically configuring the Python environment search path to ensure modularity. By utilizing the os and sys libraries, the script identifies its own absolute directory and appends a relative path—specifically the src directory located one level up—to sys.path. This setup allows the interpreter to locate and import the hello module even if it is not located in the standard library or site-packages. Once the environment is prepared, the script imports the hello function from the corresponding module. The core logic is encapsulated within a main function, which provides a simple interface to execute the imported function. When run, the script prints a descriptive message to the console and invokes hello, which is documented to output the string hello to standard output. The inclusion of the standard if name equals main boilerplate ensures that the main function only executes when the script is run directly as a standalone program, rather than when imported as a module by another script. Overall, this file illustrates basic Python project structure, path manipulation, and modular function invocation.",2025-12-26T21:26:03.036860+00:00
