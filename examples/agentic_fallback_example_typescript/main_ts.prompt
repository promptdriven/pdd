You are generating a single TypeScript source file.

TARGET FILE NAME: main.ts
GOAL: Provide a tiny console application that depends on a separate utility module `utils.ts`.
REQUIREMENTS:
- Import and call `add(a, b)` from `./utils` and print the result to STDOUT.
- Keep the file minimal.
- No external libraries; only standard TypeScript and Node.js.
- Output ONLY valid TypeScript code for main.ts (no commentary, no markdown fences).

Deliver ONLY the full contents of main.ts.
