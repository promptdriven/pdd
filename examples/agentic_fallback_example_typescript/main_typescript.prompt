You are generating a single TypeScript source file.

TARGET FILE NAME: main.ts
GOAL: Provide a tiny console application that depends on a separate utility module `utils.ts`.
REQUIREMENTS:
- Call `utils.add(a, b)` and print the result to STDOUT.
- Keep the file minimal: a main function that runs when the script is executed.
- No external libraries; only standard Node.js.
- Output ONLY valid TypeScript code for main.ts (no commentary, no markdown fences).

Deliver ONLY the full contents of main.ts.
