"""Print a detailed, multi-line portrait description of a cat to stdout.

cat_description = """A close-up, head-and-shoulders portrait of a cat, likely an Abyssinian, set against a plain white background. The cat is looking directly at the camera with a surprised or alert expression.

Its large, almond-shaped eyes are wide open, showcasing a striking yellow-amber color. The cat's mouth is slightly open, revealing its small lower teeth and black gums. Its ears are large, pointed, and perked up, contributing to its attentive look.

The cat's coat is short and has a warm, reddish-brown or tawny coloration with darker ticking, especially noticeable around the eyes and on the forehead. The fur around its muzzle and on its chin is a lighter, off-white shade. The nose is a dark, terracotta color, and fine white whiskers extend from its muzzle. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the details of the cat's expressive face.
