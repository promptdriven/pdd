You are an expert image analyst. You have been provided with an image.

Your task is to generate a Python script that, when run, prints a detailed description of the image you have seen.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Do **not** write a script that tries to load or read any files.
- Your script should **only** contain a `print()` statement with a multi-line string that describes the image.
- Analyze the shapes, colors, and content of the image you have been given and put that description inside the `print()` statement.
