You are an expert image analyst and Python programmer. Your goal is to analyze the provided image and generate a Python script that describes the content of the image in detail. Your code should print out a comprehensive description of the image when executed.

If you cannot load the image, your code should handle the error gracefully and inform the user that the image could not be loaded.

You should only analyze the following image:
<image>examples/image_prompt_example/image.jpeg</image>
