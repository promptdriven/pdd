# Order Management MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Title

**Order Management MVP**

### Project Overview

Enable customers to create and track orders end-to-end through a complete order management system.

## Goals

- Provide a complete order lifecycle management system
- Enable real-time order tracking and status updates
- Support order creation, viewing, and listing capabilities
- Deliver a seamless customer experience for order management

## Key Features

### 1. Create Order

**Description**: Allow customers to create new orders with comprehensive order details.

**Core Fields**:

- `id` - Unique order identifier
- `user_id` - Customer/user identifier
- `items[]` - Array of order items
- `total` - Total order amount
- `status` - Current order status

**Functionality**:

- Validate order data before creation
- Generate unique order ID
- Calculate order total from items
- Set initial order status
- Record order creation timestamp

### 2. View Order

**Description**: Display comprehensive order details with status timeline.

**Features**:

- Show all order information (id, user, items, total)
- Display current order status
- Show status timeline/history
- Display order creation and update timestamps
- Show item-level details

**User Experience**:

- Clean, readable order details page
- Visual status timeline
- Item breakdown with prices
- Status badges/indicators

### 3. List Orders

**Description**: Browse and search orders with filtering capabilities.

**Filter Options**:

- Filter by status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Filter by date range
- Filter by user/customer
- Sort by date, status, total amount

**Display Features**:

- Paginated order list
- Summary view (id, user, total, status, date)
- Quick actions (view details, track status)
- Search functionality

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **P95 latency < 300ms** for read endpoints (view order, list orders)
- **P95 latency < 500ms** for write endpoints (create order)
- Support concurrent order creation without conflicts

### Reliability

- **Error rate < 0.1%** for all operations
- Graceful error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Data consistency guarantees for order state transitions

### Scalability

- Handle up to 10,000 orders per day
- Support 100+ concurrent users
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

### Security

- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Users can only access their own orders (or admin access)
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Secure handling of sensitive data (user info, payment details)

## Data Model

### Order Schema

```json
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "user_id": "string (UUID)",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "quantity": "integer",
      "price": "decimal",
      "subtotal": "decimal"
    }
  ],
  "total": "decimal",
  "status": "enum (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp",
  "status_history": [
    {
      "status": "string",
      "timestamp": "timestamp",
      "note": "string (optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```
