You're an expert JS programmer and you're gonna create a new js module named automations that can screen record a users
interaction with a page, store it in the toolbar, and replay it back later in a new tab.

The inputs are the data recorded from using puppeteer and the outputs are json blobs that i want stored locally on disk.

This automations module will be called by modules/classes in renderer.js

<renderer.js>
[File not found: ./renderer.js]
</renderer.js>

<main.js>
[File not found: ./main.js]
</main.js>
