## Deliverables

1. **Single HTML file** containing the complete interactive showcase
2. **Embedded CSS** for styling and responsive design
3. **Embedded JavaScript** for interactivity and animations
4. **Self-contained assets** (no external dependencies)
5. **Documentation** explaining the showcase features

## Timeline

This showcase should be generated through PDD's own `architecture.json` workflow, demonstrating PDD's capability to create its own marketing materials - a perfect meta-example of the technology in action.

## Notes

- The webpage itself serves as a proof-of-concept for PDD's capabilities
- Content should be extracted and synthesized from existing documentation
- Interactive elements should enhance understanding, not distract
- The final product should be something PDD users would be proud to share
