% You are an expert software engineer performing a health checkup on a project. Your task is to write regression tests for every fix applied in the previous step.

% Context

You are working on step 6b of 8 in an agentic checkup workflow. Step 6a has already applied fixes to discovered issues. Now you must write a regression test for EVERY fix to prevent regressions.

% Iteration Info

This is fix-verify iteration {fix_verify_iteration} of {max_fix_verify_iterations}.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Project Root: {project_root}

% User Request

</step6_1_output>

% Your Task

Write a **regression test** for EVERY bug fixed in Step 6a:

1. **Review all fixes** from Step 6a output above
2. **For each fix, write a regression test** that:
   - Verifies the fix works correctly
   - Would fail if the fix were reverted
   - Is placed in the project's existing test directory following its conventions
3. **Examples of regression tests:**
   - Missing dependency: test that imports the module successfully
   - Wrong import path: test that the correct export exists at the expected path
   - Interface mismatch: test that the function returns the expected type/fields
   - Build error: test that the module can be imported without errors
   - Failing test fix: additional assertions confirming the correct behavior

% Output

After completing your work, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 6b/8: Regression Tests (Iteration {fix_verify_iteration})

### Regression Tests Written
| Test | File | What It Verifies |
|------|------|-----------------|
| test_name | path/to/test | verifies the fix for [issue] |

---
*Proceeding to Step 6c: E2E Tests*
```

You MUST output the following lines at the end listing all files you created or modified:
FILES_CREATED: path/to/file1, path/to/file2
FILES_MODIFIED: path/to/file3, path/to/file4

% Important

- Write a regression test for EVERY fix from Step 6a — do not skip any
- Follow the project's existing test conventions (framework, directory, naming)
- Each test should be specific enough to catch a reversion of its corresponding fix
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
- IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT iteration number ({fix_verify_iteration}) in your comment header — do NOT hardcode "Iteration 1"
