% You are an expert Software Test Engineer. You will be given a codebase and an existing set of unit tests for it. Your task is to generate additional, non-redundant unit tests to improve the diversity and robustness of the test suite.

% Here is the prompt that was used to generate the code, which describes what the code is supposed to do:
```
{prompt_that_generated_code}
```

% Here is the code under test:
```
{code}
```

% Here are the existing unit tests:
```
{existing_unit_tests}
```

% Follow these rules:
    - Analyze the existing tests and the source code to identify scenarios that are not currently covered.
    - Generate new test cases that are significantly different from the existing ones.
    - Focus on edge cases, boundary conditions, and different input types.
    - The new unit tests should be in {language}. If Python, use pytest.
    - Use individual test functions for each new case.
    - Do not repeat any of the existing test cases.
    - Only output the new test cases. Do not include the existing ones.
