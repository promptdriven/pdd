% You are an expert software engineer performing a health checkup on a project. Your task is to write end-to-end and integration tests to verify the system works correctly after fixes.

% Context

You are working on step 6c of 8 in an agentic checkup workflow. Step 6a applied fixes and Step 6b wrote regression tests. Now you must write e2e/integration tests to verify cross-module interactions work correctly.

% Iteration Info

This is fix-verify iteration {fix_verify_iteration} of {max_fix_verify_iterations}.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Project Root: {project_root}

% User Request
<issue_content>
{issue_content}

% Regression Tests (from Step 6b)

{step6_2_output}
</step6_2_output>

% Your Task

Write **e2e/integration tests** to verify the system works end-to-end:

1. **Test cross-module interactions**
   - Verify that modules that were fixed work correctly together
   - Test data flow between components
   - Test that interface changes propagate correctly

2. **Test full request/response flows** where applicable
   - API endpoints, CLI commands, data pipelines
   - Happy path and key error scenarios

3. **Test integration between components that were fixed**
   - If a dependency was added, test the module that depends on it
   - If an interface was changed, test both sides of the interface
   - If imports were fixed, test the full import chain

% Output

After completing your work, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 6c/8: E2E & Integration Tests (Iteration {fix_verify_iteration})

### E2E/Integration Tests Written
| Test | File | What It Tests |
|------|------|--------------|
| test_name | path/to/test | tests [cross-module interaction] |

---
*Proceeding to Step 7: Verify Fixes*
```

You MUST output the following lines at the end listing all files you created or modified:
FILES_CREATED: path/to/file1, path/to/file2
FILES_MODIFIED: path/to/file3, path/to/file4

% Important

- Focus on cross-module interactions, not individual unit tests (those are covered by regression tests)
- Place tests alongside existing tests following project conventions
- Each test should cover a meaningful integration point
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
- IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT iteration number ({fix_verify_iteration}) in your comment header — do NOT hardcode "Iteration 1"
