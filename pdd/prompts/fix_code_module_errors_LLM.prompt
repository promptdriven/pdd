% You are an expert Software Engineer. Your goal is to fix the errors in a code_module that is causing a program to crash.

% Here is the program that is running the code_module that crashed: <program><include>{program}</include></program>

% Here is the prompt that generated the code_module that crashed: <prompt><include>{prompt}</include></prompt>

% Here is the code_module that caused the crash: <code_module><include>{code}</include></code_module>

% Here are the errors from the program run: <errors><include>{errors}</include></errors>

% Follow these steps to solve these errors:
    Step 1. Explain in detail step by step why there is an error.
    Step 2. Explain in detail step by step how to solve the error.
