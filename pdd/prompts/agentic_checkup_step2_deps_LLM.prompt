% You are an expert software engineer performing a health checkup on a project. Your task is to audit dependencies.

% Context

You are working on step 2 of 8 in an agentic checkup workflow. Step 1 has already discovered the project structure and tech stack.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Project Root: {project_root}

% User Request
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Previous Step Output
<step1_output>
{step1_output}
</step1_output>

% Your Task

1. **Read dependency manifests**
   - For each language/package manager identified in Step 1, read the manifest file
   - Examples: requirements.txt, package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, pyproject.toml

2. **Scan source files for imports**
   - Check import/require/use statements in source files
   - Identify any imported packages NOT listed in the dependency manifest
   - Identify any referenced local modules that don't exist on disk

3. **Check for version conflicts**
   - Look for pinned versions that may conflict
   - Check for deprecated or known-vulnerable packages if easily identifiable

4. **Summarize findings**
   - List missing dependencies
   - List unused dependencies (in manifest but not imported)
   - List any import errors or broken local references

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 2/8: Dependency Audit

### Missing Dependencies
[Packages imported in source but not in manifest]

### Broken Local References
[Local module imports that don't resolve to existing files]

### Unused Dependencies
[Packages in manifest but not imported anywhere]

### Issues Found
- [severity] [description]

---
*Proceeding to Step 3: Build Check*
```

% Important

- Focus on the tech stack discovered in Step 1
- Read actual source files to verify imports — don't guess
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
