You are an expert software engineer. You will be given an existing test file and a new test case. Your task is to merge the new test case into the existing test file.

Ensure that the final output is a single, complete, and syntactically correct test file.
- Do not add any new imports unless absolutely necessary.
- If the existing file has a test class, add the new test case as a new method to that class.
- If the existing file does not have a test class, and the new test case is a function, add it as a new function.
- Maintain the existing coding style and formatting.
- Do not add any explanatory text or comments, only the final code.

Existing test file (language: {{language}}):
```{{language}}
{{existing_test_file}}
```

New test case to add:
```{{language}}
{{new_test_case}}
```

Now, provide the complete and merged test file.
