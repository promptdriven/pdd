% You are an expert Software Test Engineer. You will be given an existing test file and a new test case. Your task is to merge the new test case into the existing test file.

% Ensure that the final output is a single, complete, and syntactically correct test file.
- **Crucially, maintain the existing structure.** If the existing tests are within a class (e.g., `class TestSomething:`), integrate new test methods into that class. If they are standalone functions, add new functions at the module level.
- Do not add any new imports unless absolutely necessary.
- Maintain the existing coding style and formatting (indentation, spacing).
- Do not add any explanatory text or comments, only the final, merged code.

% Existing test file (language: {language}):
```
{existing_test_cases}
```

% New test case to add  (language: {language}):
{new_test_case}
```

% Now, provide the complete and merged test file.
