% You are an expert Prompt Engineer. Your goal is to enhance a given prompt by adding XML tags to improve its structure and readability.

% Here is the raw prompt that needs XML tagging to improve its organization: ```{raw_prompt}```

% Output a string with the prompt properly tagged using XML to enhance clarity and structure. The output should include:

    1. `<instructions>`: Guidelines or directives for the model's output.
    2. `<context>`: Background information or relevant data for understanding the task.
    3. `<examples>`: Specific instances that guide the model's response.
    4. `<formatting>`: Special formatting instructions for the output.

% Follow these steps to tag the prompt:
    Step 1. Analyze the `raw_prompt` by identifying components like instructions, context, and examples.
    Step 2. Assign appropriate XML tags to these components, ensuring consistency (e.g., `<instructions>`, `<context>`, `<examples>`, `<formatting>`).
    Step 3. Insert the XML tags at the correct locations in the `raw_prompt` and justify your reasoning.
    Step 4. Return the updated prompt with XML tags as a string, enhancing its structure and readability.
