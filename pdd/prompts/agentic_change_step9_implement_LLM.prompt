% You are an expert software engineer using Prompt-Driven Development (PDD). Your task is to implement the prompt changes analyzed in the previous step.

% Context

You are working on step 9 of 12 in an agentic change workflow. Previous steps reviewed architecture and analyzed exactly what prompt changes are needed.

**This step modifies files.** All changes are made in a git worktree to avoid affecting the main branch.

% CRITICAL: Scope

**You MAY read** any files to understand the codebase.

**This workflow CREATES/MODIFIES ONLY:**
- Prompt files (`.prompt` files)
- Documentation files (`.md`, `.txt`, etc.)

**FORBIDDEN - Do NOT create or modify:**
- Code files (these are GENERATED from prompts via `pdd sync`)
- Example files (these are GENERATED artifacts)
- Test files (these are updated during `pdd sync`)

Violating this scope is a CRITICAL ERROR that should stop the workflow.

Code generation happens separately via `pdd sync` after the PR is merged.

% PDD Background

<pdd_prompting_guide>
<include>docs/prompting_guide.md</include>
</pdd_prompting_guide>

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Worktree Path: {worktree_path}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>

% Your Task

1. **Navigate to worktree**
   - Change to the worktree directory: {worktree_path}
   - All file modifications happen here, not in the main repo

2. **Implement documentation changes from Step 5**
   For each documentation file identified in Step 5's output:
   - Update README.md (or equivalent) with new command documentation
   - Update docs/ files with guides, tutorials, or API docs
   - Follow the draft content provided in Step 5
   - Preserve existing formatting and style conventions

3. **Modify existing prompts**
   For each prompt identified for modification in Step 8:
   - Read the current prompt file
   - Apply the changes specified in Step 8
   - Preserve existing structure and formatting
   - Keep the prompt concise (10-30% of expected code size)

4. **Create new prompts**
   For each new prompt identified in Step 8:
   - Use the standard prompt structure, adapting paths based on the project's .pddrc (from Step 6):
     ```
     <include>context/{language}_preamble.prompt</include>

     % Goal
     [One sentence describing the module]

     % Role & Scope
     [Module purpose and boundaries]

     % Requirements
     1. [Testable requirement]
     2. [Testable requirement]
     ...

     % Dependencies
     <module_name><include>{example_dir}/module_example.{ext}</include></module_name>

     % Deliverables
     - Code: `{source_dir}/module_name.{ext}`
     ```

   Substitute actual values from the project's .pddrc:
   - `{language}`: from `default_language` (e.g., `python`, `typescript`)
   - `{example_dir}`: from `example_output_path` (e.g., `context/`, `examples/`)
   - `{source_dir}`: from `generate_output_path` (e.g., `src/`, `lib/`, `pdd/`)
   - `{ext}`: file extension for the language (e.g., `.py`, `.ts`)

5. **Final Validation: No Code Duplication (CRITICAL)**
   Before completing, verify:
   - Each new prompt creates functionality that does NOT exist elsewhere in the codebase
   - No prompt duplicates logic from another module (if it does, extend the existing module instead)
   - The dependency graph makes sense (no circular dependencies, proper layering)

   If duplication is detected, STOP and recommend modifying an existing prompt instead of creating a new one.

6. **Track changes**
   - Report all files modified with `FILES_MODIFIED:` prefix
   - Report all files created with `FILES_CREATED:` prefix

% Output

After completing your changes, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

**If changes successful:**
```markdown
## Step 9: Implement Changes

**Status:** Changes Applied

### Files Modified
FILES_MODIFIED: prompts/xxx_{lang}.prompt, README.md

### Files Created
FILES_CREATED: prompts/yyy_{lang}.prompt

*(Use actual language from project's .pddrc)*

### Summary of Changes

#### `prompts/xxx_{lang}.prompt`
- Added requirement for [feature]
- Updated dependency to include [module]

#### `prompts/yyy_{lang}.prompt` (new)
- Created new prompt for [purpose]
- Includes [N] requirements

### Worktree Location
Changes are in: `{worktree_path}`

### Next Steps
After review, run `pdd sync` on modified prompts to regenerate code.

---
*Proceeding to Step 10: Identify Issues*
```

**If changes failed (STOP workflow):**
```markdown
## Step 9: Implement Changes

**Status:** FAIL: Implementation Error

### Error Details
[What went wrong]

### Attempted Changes
[What was attempted before failure]

### Recommendation
[How to resolve the issue]

---
*Investigation paused - implementation failed.*
```

% Important

- All changes must be in the worktree, not the main repo
- Follow PDD prompt conventions strictly
- If implementation fails, STOP the workflow
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing

% CRITICAL: Scope Validation

Before completing, verify:
1. ALL files in FILES_MODIFIED and FILES_CREATED are `.prompt` or documentation files
2. NO code files appear in the changeset
3. NO example files were created or modified

If you modified or created ANY code or example file, this is a CRITICAL ERROR:
- Undo those changes
- Only implement the prompt/doc changes
- Report the scope violation in your output

SCOPE_VIOLATION: [Yes/No]

% CRITICAL: Output Format for File Tracking

Your final response MUST include these exact lines for the orchestrator to parse:

```
FILES_MODIFIED: prompts/file1_{lang}.prompt, prompts/file2_{lang}.prompt
FILES_CREATED: prompts/file3_{lang}.prompt
```

These lines MUST:
- Start with `FILES_MODIFIED:` or `FILES_CREATED:` exactly (case-insensitive)
- Be followed by a comma-separated list of file paths on the SAME LINE
- NOT use markdown bullets, numbered lists, or multi-line formats
- Appear in your final summary (not just in the GitHub comment)
- Use actual language from project's .pddrc (e.g., `_python`, `_typescript`)

Example of CORRECT format:
```
FILES_MODIFIED: prompts/sync_main_python.prompt, prompts/fix_error_loop_python.prompt
FILES_CREATED: prompts/parallel_fix_python.prompt
```

(Substitute actual language suffix based on project configuration)

Example of WRONG format (will cause workflow failure):
```
### Files Modified:
1. prompts/sync_main_python.prompt
2. prompts/fix_error_loop_python.prompt
```
