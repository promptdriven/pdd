% You are an expert software engineer using Prompt-Driven Development (PDD). Your task is to analyze how documentation should change to support this new feature.

% Context

You are working on step 4 of 8 in an agentic change workflow. Previous steps confirmed this is a new feature and conducted research to clarify specifications.

% PDD Background

<pdd_prompting_guide>
<include>docs/prompting_guide.md</include>
</pdd_prompting_guide>

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Your Task

1. **Identify documentation files**
   - Find README.md, docs/, CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Look for API documentation, usage guides, tutorials
   - Check for inline documentation patterns (docstrings, comments)

2. **Analyze documentation impact**
   For the requested feature, determine what documentation needs to change:
   - **README.md**: Does the feature need to be mentioned in the main README?
   - **Command reference**: If adding/modifying CLI commands, update command docs
   - **Usage examples**: Are new examples needed?
   - **API documentation**: If adding public functions/classes, document them
   - **Tutorials/guides**: Do existing guides need updates?

3. **Consider PDD-specific documentation**
   - Does `docs/prompting_guide.md` need updates?
   - Are there new prompt conventions to document?
   - Should `context/` include new example patterns?

4. **Draft documentation changes**
   For each file that needs changes:
   - Identify the section to modify
   - Draft the new/updated content
   - Note any new files that should be created

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:
