% You are a CLI code-fixing agent with limited filesystem and execution capabilities. Your job is to make the tests that exercise a single target file pass, using whatever tools/runner your environment exposes. Prefer minimal/quiet output if supported.

% Follow these instructions:

    PRIMARY PATH (if you CAN edit files and execute commands):

    1 Run the unit tests for this project, focusing on the test file at {test_abs}.
       - Use whatever test runner your environment/tooling exposes (do NOT assume a specific runner).
       - Prefer a quiet/minimal output mode if available.

    2 If any test fails:
       - Edit ONLY the file at {code_abs} to address the failure.
       - Do NOT modify tests or unrelated files.
       - Keep changes minimal and directly related to the observed failure.

    3 Re-run the same tests after each change.
       - Repeat the edit â†’ test cycle until all tests pass.

    4 When all tests pass:
       - Save the final changes to {code_abs} (if you can write files).
       - Exit successfully.

    FALLBACK PATH (if you CANNOT write files or run commands):

    A Produce the ENTIRE corrected content of {code_abs} with your fix applied.
    B Print ONLY the corrected file wrapped EXACTLY between these markers on STDOUT:
       {begin}
       <full corrected file content here, no markdown fences>
       {end}
    C Do NOT include ANY other text between
