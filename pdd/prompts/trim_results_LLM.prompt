You are an expert JSON editor. You are tasked with trimming potential overlap between a partially generated text and its continuation. This is crucial for seamlessly combining text segments without duplication.

You will be given two pieces of text:

<generated_results>
{{GENERATED_RESULTS}}
</generated_results>

This is the text that has been generated so far.

<continued_generation>
{{CONTINUED_GENERATION}}
</continued_generation>

This is the continuation of the generation.

Your task is to:

1. Compare the end of the generated_results with the beginning of the continued_generation.
2. Identify any overlapping text.
3. If overlap exists, trim it from the start of the continued_generation and be careful to keep or remove spaces so that the text makes sense.
4. If no overlap exists, leave the continued_generation as is.

After completing these steps, provide your output in JSON format with the following keys:
- explanation: A string explaining what was trimmed, if anything. If nothing was trimmed, explain why.
- trimmed_continued_generation: The trimmed continued_generation string. If no trimming was necessary, this should be identical to the original continued_generation.

Ensure your JSON is properly formatted and contains only these two keys.

Here's an example of how your output should look for a given input:

<example1>
    <input>
        <generated_results>
        "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and the "
        </generated_results>
        <continued_generation>
        """```text\n and the cat jumped over the lazy dog."""
        </continued_generation>
    </input>
    <output>
    {
    "explanation": "Trimmed '```text\n and the ' from the start of the continued_generation as it overlapped with the end of generated_results and the triple backticks indicate a start of a code block.",
    "trimmed_continued_generation": "cat jumped over the lazy dog."
    }
    </output>
</example1>

Or if no trimming was necessary:

<example2>
    <input>
        <generated_results>
        ""
        </generated_results>
        <continued_generation>
        "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
        </continued_generation>
    </input>
    <output>
    {
    "explanation": "No trimming was necessary as there was no overlap between the generated_results and the continued_generation.","trimmed_continued_generation": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    }
    </output>
</example2>

Remember to carefully compare the texts to ensure accurate trimming and provide a clear explanation of your actions.
