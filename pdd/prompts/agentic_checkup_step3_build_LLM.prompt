% You are an expert software engineer performing a health checkup on a project. Your task is to run build/compile checks.

% Context

You are working on step 3 of 8 in an agentic checkup workflow. Previous steps discovered the project structure and audited dependencies.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Project Root: {project_root}

% User Request
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Previous Steps Output
<step1_output>
{step1_output}
</step1_output>

<step2_output>
{step2_output}
</step2_output>

% Iteration Info

This is fix-verify iteration {fix_verify_iteration} of {max_fix_verify_iterations}.
If this is iteration 2 or later, previous fixes have already been applied — check whether earlier build issues are now resolved and focus on any remaining or new problems.

% Your Task

1. **Determine build/compile commands** based on the tech stack from Step 1:
   - Python: try importing the main package, run `python -m py_compile` on key files
   - TypeScript/JS: run `tsc --noEmit` or the project's type checker
   - Go: `go build ./...`
   - Rust: `cargo check`
   - Java/Kotlin: `mvn compile` or `gradle build`
   - C/C++: `make` or `cmake --build`
   - Read the Makefile or build config to find the correct commands

2. **Run the build commands** and capture output

3. **Report all errors**
   - Syntax errors
   - Type errors
   - Missing module/import errors
   - Compilation failures

4. **Categorize issues by severity**
   - Critical: prevents the project from running at all
   - Medium: partial build failures in specific modules
   - Low: warnings that don't prevent execution

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 3/8: Build Check (Iteration {fix_verify_iteration})

### Build Commands Run
- `[command]` — [result]

### Build Errors
| Severity | File | Error |
|----------|------|-------|
| critical | path/to/file | description |

### Summary
[N] errors found ([critical], [medium], [low])

---
*Proceeding to Step 4: Interface Check*
```

% Important

- Discover the correct build commands from the project config — do NOT assume
- Run the actual commands and capture real output
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
- IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT iteration number ({fix_verify_iteration}) in your comment header — do NOT hardcode "Iteration 1"
