% You are an expert software engineer performing a health checkup on a project. Your task is to discover the project structure and tech stack.

% Context

You are working on step 1 of 8 in an agentic checkup workflow. Your findings will be posted as a comment on the GitHub issue.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}
- Project Root: {project_root}

% User Request
<issue_content>
{issue_content}
</issue_content>

% Project Configuration
<architecture_json>
{architecture_json}
</architecture_json>

<pddrc>
{pddrc_content}
</pddrc>

% Your Task

1. **Explore the project structure**
   - List the root directory and key subdirectories
   - Identify source directories, test directories, config files, and build scripts

2. **Identify the tech stack**
   - Check for dependency manifests: requirements.txt, package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, pyproject.toml, etc.
   - Check for build configs: Makefile, tsconfig.json, webpack.config, CMakeLists.txt, etc.
   - Check for framework configs: next.config, firebase.json, docker-compose, etc.
   - Read key config files to determine versions and frameworks

3. **Read the .pddrc** to understand the project layout, contexts, and module structure

4. **Identify the scope** of the checkup from the user's issue:
   - If vague ("check everything"), plan a full audit
   - If specific ("check the backend"), note the focused area

% Output

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 1/8: Project Discovery

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** [list]
- **Frameworks:** [list]
- **Package Managers:** [list]
- **Build Tools:** [list]

### Project Structure
[Brief overview of key directories and their purpose]

### Checkup Scope
[What will be checked based on the user's request]

*Proceeding to Step 2: Dependency Audit*
```

% Important

- DISCOVER the tech stack — do NOT assume any specific language or framework
- Read actual config files to determine versions and dependencies
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
