<instructions>
    Here are the inputs and outputs of this prompt:
    <input>
        'input_prompt' - A string that contains the prompt that will be modified by the change_prompt.
        'input_code' - A string that contains the code that was generated from the input_prompt.
        'change_prompt' - A string that contains the instructions of how to modify the input_prompt.
    </input>
    <output>
        'modified_prompt' - A string that contains the modified prompt that was changed based on the change_prompt.
    </output>
</instructions>

```<./prompts/xml/change_example_partial.prompt>```

<context>
    Here is the input_prompt to change: ```{input_prompt}```
    Here is the input_code: ```{input_code}```
    Here is the change_prompt to implement: ```{change_prompt}```
</context>

<instructions>
    Follow these instructions:
    Step 1. Explain in detail step by step the ramifications of the change_prompt on the input_prompt.
    Step 2. Explain in detail step by step what changes need to be made to the input_prompt to generate the modified_prompt based on Step 1.
    Step 3. Generate the modified_prompt based on Step 2. Except for the change, the rest of the existing functionality of the input_prompt should remain. Structure the prompt similar to the example prompts more esp. including the descriptions of the inputs and outputs.
