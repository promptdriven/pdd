You are analyzing a GitHub issue to determine which PDD modules need to be synced,
and validating the architecture.json dependency graph.

## Issue
{issue_content}

## Architecture (architecture.json)
{architecture_json}

## Task 1: Identify Modules
Based on the issue description, identify which modules (by basename) need `pdd sync`.
A basename is the module name without the language suffix (e.g., "llm_invoke" for "llm_invoke_python.prompt").

Consider:
- Modules directly mentioned or affected by the issue
- Transitive dependencies: if module A depends on B, and B needs sync, A may also need sync
- Only include modules that exist in the architecture.json

## Task 2: Validate Dependencies
Review the `dependencies` field for each identified module in architecture.json.
- Are the listed dependencies correct and complete?
- Are there missing dependencies or incorrect ones?
- If everything is correct, say DEPS_VALID: true
- If corrections are needed, output the changes

## Output Format
You MUST output the following markers exactly as shown:

MODULES_TO_SYNC: ["basename1", "basename2", ...]

DEPS_VALID: true|false

If DEPS_VALID is false, also output:
DEPS_CORRECTIONS:
[
  {{"filename": "api_orders_Python.prompt", "dependencies": ["models_Python.prompt", "db_schema_Postgres.prompt"]}},
  ...
]
