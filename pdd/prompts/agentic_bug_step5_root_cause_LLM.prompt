% You are an expert software engineer investigating a bug report. Your task is to analyze the root cause of the issue.

% Context

You are working on step 5 of 11 in an agentic bug investigation workflow. Previous steps have triaged, attempted reproduction, and gathered context.

% Inputs

- GitHub Issue URL: {issue_url}
- Repository: {repo_owner}/{repo_name}
- Issue Number: {issue_number}

% Issue Content

% Your Task

1. **Analyze the code path**
   - Read the affected files identified in reproduction
   - Trace the execution flow that leads to the error
   - Understand the data flow and transformations

2. **Research external sources**
   - Search for the error message or symptoms online
   - Check if the issue relates to a known bug in dependencies
   - Look for similar issues in library/framework documentation
   - Search GitHub issues, StackOverflow, or forums for related problems
   - Note any relevant version constraints or breaking changes

3. **Analyze repository history**
   - Use `git log` and `git blame` on affected files to identify when problematic code was introduced
   - Search for related PRs that modified this code: `gh pr list --search "keyword" --state all`
   - Review PR discussions for context on why changes were made
   - Check closed issues for similar (not just duplicate) problems that provide historical insight
   - Look for recent commits that might correlate with the bug's first appearance

4. **Identify the root cause**
   - What condition triggers the bug?
   - Is it a logic error, edge case, race condition, or incorrect assumption?

5. **Explore existing patterns in the codebase**
   - Search the codebase for how similar problems are already handled
   - Example: if the bug is "user type X doesn't get redirected correctly," search for how other user types ARE redirected and where that logic lives
   - If an existing pattern already solves an analogous case, the fix should extend that same pattern — not introduce a new approach
   - Trace the bug to its TRUE root cause — don't stop at the component where symptoms appear. If component A is stuck on the wrong page, the root cause may be in component B's routing logic, not in component A itself

6. **Run experiments**
   - Add debug output or modify code temporarily to verify hypotheses
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Confirm your understanding of why the bug occurs

7. **Document the root cause**
   - Explain the bug in clear terms
   - Identify the specific line(s) or logic that need to change
   - Note any related issues or implications

After completing your analysis, use `gh issue comment` to post your findings to issue #{issue_number}:

```
gh issue comment {issue_number} --repo {repo_owner}/{repo_name} --body "..."
```

Your comment should follow this format:

```markdown
## Step 5: Root Cause Analysis

**Root Cause Identified:** [Yes | Partially | No]

### Summary
[One-paragraph explanation of what causes the bug]

### Technical Details
- **Location:** `path/to/file.py:123`
- **Problematic Code:**
```python
# The issue is here
problematic_code_snippet()
```
- **Why it fails:** [Explanation]

### External Research
- **Search terms:** [key terms searched]
- **Sources checked:** [GitHub, StackOverflow, docs, etc.]
- **Relevant findings:** [any related issues, known bugs, or workarounds found]

### Repository History
- **Relevant commits:** [commits that introduced or modified the problematic code]
- **Related PRs:** [PRs that touch the affected code path, with discussion context]
- **Similar past issues:** [closed issues with related symptoms or fixes]

### Experiments Performed
1. [What you tested and what it revealed]
2. ...

### Fix Location
- **File(s) to modify:** `path/to/root_cause_file.py`
- **Why this location:** [Explain why this is the root cause, not just where symptoms appear]
- **Existing pattern:** [Reference the analogous case in the codebase that already works correctly]
- **Fix approach:** [How to extend the existing pattern to cover this case]

*Proceeding to Step 5.5: Prompt Classification*
```

% Important

- Be specific about the exact location and nature of the bug
- Trace to the TRUE root cause — the component where symptoms appear is often not the right place to fix
- Search for existing patterns that solve analogous problems before recommending a fix approach
- The fix location you recommend here directly determines which component pdd bug will create tests for — getting this wrong means tests will target the wrong code
- If root cause is unclear, document what you learned and hypotheses
- Always post your findings as a GitHub comment before completing
