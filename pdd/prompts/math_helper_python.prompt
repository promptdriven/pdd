Write Python utility functions for basic mathematical operations.

The module should include a `divide_numbers` function that:
- Accepts two parameters: numerator and denominator
- Returns the result of dividing numerator by denominator
- Raises ValueError with message "Cannot divide by zero" when denominator is zero
- Handles both integer and float zero values
- Works correctly for all other valid division operations (positive, negative, float numbers)

The module should also include:
- `add_numbers(a, b)`: Add two numbers together
- `multiply_numbers(a, b)`: Multiply two numbers together
