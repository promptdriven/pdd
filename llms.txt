# PDD (Prompt-Driven Development)

> PDD is a complete AI toolchain for generating and maintaining codebases reliably and repeatably using the prompt-driven approach. Each PDD prompt is a mini-spec of a single output file, giving you tight control and ensuring each output file is reliably re-generated from its prompt.

Key concepts:

- **Prompts as Source of Truth**: Prompts are authoritative; code is a generated artifact
- **One Prompt per Output File**: Laser-focuses the LLM on a single target, reducing hallucination
- **Regenerative Development**: Modify prompts and fully regenerate code rather than patching
- **Accumulated Tests**: PDD detects/fixes bugs and accumulates unit and regression tests automatically

PDD is an excellent complement to agentic coding tools (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.) - use PDD for long-lived codebases and repeatedly-rebuilt tasks; use agentic coders for incremental, one-off, or ephemeral tasks.
